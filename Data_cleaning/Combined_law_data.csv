     [Constitution]","14. Equality before law The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Editorial Comment -Article 14 rejects any type of discrimination based on caste, race, and religion, place of birth or sex. This Article is having a wide ambit and applicability to safeguard the rights of people residing in India. This article is divided into two parts: Equality before the Law: This part of the article indicates that all are to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. This is a negative concept as it implies the absence of any privilege in favor of any person. This is a substantive part of the article. Equal protection of the Laws: This part means that the same law will be applied to all the people equally across the society. This is a positive concept as it expects a positive action from the state. This is a procedural part of article 14. “The dissent of Justice Subba Rao in the State of U.P. v. Deoman Upadhyaya 1960 stated that Article 14 comprises both “positive content” as well as “negative content”. Whereas, equality before the law is a negative content, equal protection of the laws exhibits a positive content of Article 14.” The doctrine of Anti Arbitrariness:  The scope of article 14 was drastically increased by the Supreme Court by including the executive discretion under its ambit. In the case of E.P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu , 1974, the court said that Article 14 gives a guarantee against the arbitrary actions of the State. The Right to Equality is against arbitrariness. They both are enemies to each other. So it is important to protect the laws from the arbitrary actions of the Executive. “The first landmark judgment which actually spotted the virtue of non-arbitrariness in Article 14 was S.G. Jaisinghani v. Union of India . The Court, for the first time held “absence of arbitrary power” as sine qua non to rule of law with confined and defined discretion, both of which are essential facets of Article 14.” In here Justice Subba Rao elaborating on the wide expanse of Article 14 , vide para 14 held thus: “In this context it is important to emphasize that the absence of arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of law upon which our whole constitutional system is based. In a system governed by rule of law, discretion, when conferred upon executive authorities, must be confined within clearly defined limits.” In the Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, 1978,  Justice Bhagwati said that Equality is against the arbitrariness of State action. So this doctrine ensures equality of treatment. “The seven-Judge Bench held that a trinity exists between Article 14, Article 19 and Article 21. All these articles have to be read together. Any law interfering with personal liberty of a person must satisfy a triple test: (i) it must prescribe a procedure; (ii) the procedure must withstand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article 19 which may be applicable in a given situation; and (iii) it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article 14.” Natural Justice as a part of Article 14: From the case of A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India , It is evident that Natural Justice (natural justice is technical terminology for the rule against bias and the right to a fair hearing (audi alteram partem)) is an integral part of Article 14.  The court held that “the Principle of Natural Justice helps in the prevention of miscarriage of Justice, These Principles also check the arbitrary power of the State.” Classification Test: In the case of Ram Krishna Dalmia v. Justice Tendolkar, 1958 the Supreme Court describes the jurisprudence of equality before the law. It simply permits the State to make differential classification of subjects (which would otherwise be prohibited by Article 14) provided that the classification is founded on intelligible differentia (i.e. objects within the class are clearly distinguishable from those that are outside) and has a rational nexus with the objective sought to be achieved by the classification. In the case of Indra Sawhney v UOI, 1993 which is a landmark judgment on aspects of reservation in India. “The Court interpreted the relation between Article 14 and Article 16. It was held that Article 16(1) is a facet of Article 14. Just as Article 14 permits reasonable classification, so does Article 16(1). A classification may involve reservation of seats or vacancies. The principle aims of Article 14 and 16 is equality and equality of opportunity and Clause (4) of Article 16 is a means of achieving the very same objective. Both the provisions have to be harmonized keeping in mind the fact that both are the restatements of the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14.” Further expansion of Article 14 was done in the case of Visakha v State of Rajasthan, 1997 “The judgment sought to enforce the fundamental rights of working women under Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. Sexual Harassment violates the fundamental right of the women of gender equality which is codified under Article 14 of Indian Constitution and also the fundamental right to life and to live a dignified life. The Court held that even though there is no express provision for sexual harassment at workplace under Indian Constitution, it is implicit through these fundamental rights.” (references mentioned below) Expansion of Article 14 in terms of defining Gender: In the case of National Legal Service Authority [NALSA] v UOI, 2014 . “This case was filed by the National Legal Services Authority of India (NALSA) to legally recognize persons who fall outside the male/female gender binary, including persons who identify as “third gender”. While drawing attention to the fact that transgender persons were subject to “extreme discrimination in all spheres of society”, the Court held that the right to equality (Article 14 of the Constitution) was framed in gender-neutral terms (“all persons”). Consequently, the right to equality would extend to transgender persons also.” Further in Shayara Bano v UOI, 2016 “the 5 Judge Bench of the Supreme Court pronounced its decision in the Triple Talaq Case, declaring that the practice of instantaneous triple talaq [Talaq-ul-biddat] was unconstitutional. The Bench observed that the fundamental right to equality guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution, manifested within its fold, equality of status. Gender equality, gender equity and gender justice are values intrinsically entwined in the guarantee of equality, under Article 14.” These above discussed landmark cases and many more have contributed to expand the ambit and scope of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, to strive for a more equal and fair society.

Originally, Article 3, did not prescribe a time limit for expression of views by the States on the States reorganization laws. It was feared that the States could forestall the passage of the State Reorganisation Act by not expressing their views for any length of time.

     [Constitution]","12. Definition In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, ""the State"" includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India. Editorial Comment - This article provides the definition of the “state” in India and the various organs which come under it. This definition of the State under Article 12 is applicable only for Part 3 (Fundamental Rights) and Part 4 (Directive Principles of State Policy) of the Constitution of India. The meaning of “Other Authorities” under Article 12 can be understood by looking at leading case laws such as In the case of Rajasthan State Electricity Board v. Mohanlal, AIR 1967 wherein it was decided that “other authorities is wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute on which powers are conferred to carry out governmental or quasi-governmental functions and functioning within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.” The court further laid down the guidelines for deciding ‘any authority’ as ‘Other Authority’ under Article 12, ​In the case of Ramana Dayaram Shetty v. The International Airport (1979): “If the entire shares are owned by the Government, “If almost the entire expenditure is done by the Government”, “If there is a state conferred monopoly in that corporation”, “Whenever there is deep and pervasive control by the Government” and “If the functions by the corporation are of Public importance” and lastly, “If a department of the Government is transferred to a corporation.” Indian Courts have interpreted the meaning of 'State' in various contexts over time to extend the dimension of Fundamental Rights. In the case of University of Madras v. Santa Bai , the Madras High Court evolved the principle of ejusdem generis i.e. of the “like nature”. It means that those authorities are covered under the expression 'other authorities’ which perform governmental or sovereign functions. In Sukhdev v. Bhagatram, LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) , ONGC (Oil and Natural Gas Corporation) and IFC (International Finance Corporation) were held to be state as they perform very similar functions which seem to be governmental or sovereign functions. Another set of discussions have been around the fact of the Judiciary becoming part of the state. Eminent Jurists like H.M.Seervai, V.N.Shukla consider judiciary to be State. Their view is supported by Articles 145 and 146 of the Constitution of India. “It was held that the Supreme Court is empowered to make rules for regulating the practice and procedure of Courts and is also empowered to make appointments of its staff and servants and decide its service conditions.” In Prem Garg v. Excise Commissioner H.P. The Supreme Court held that when rule making power of the judiciary is concerned, it is ‘state’. There have been contrary opinions on this subject too. In Rati Lal v. State of Bombay , it was held that the judiciary is not state for the purpose of Article 12. In A.R.Antulay v. R.S.Nayak and N.S.Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra , it has been observed that “when rule making power of judiciary is concerned it is state but when exercise of judicial power is concerned it is not state.” Thus, the word 'state' under Article 12 jurisprudence has evolved in India through various interpretations and discussions in the High courts and the Supreme court. It has been given a wider meaning which ensures that Part-III of the constitution can be applied to a larger extent.

     [Constitution]","13. Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of the fundamental rights (1) All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Pan, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void. (2) The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of the contravention, be void. (3) In this article, unless the context otherwise requires,- (a) ""law"" includes any Ordinance, order, bye-law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law; (b) ""laws in force"" includes laws passed or made by Legislature or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed, notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas. (4) Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article 368. [ Editorial comment - ​Article 13 (1) discusses the laws which were made before the commencement of the Constitution (26 January 1950) and Article 13 (2) delves about the laws which are made after the Constitution is in place. ​Article 13 (1) states that all the laws which are made before the Constitution will be void as long as they are violating the provisions of the Fundamental Rights. It further states that only that part of the law which will be void which is against the provisions of the constitution and not the whole law itself. This guarantee is against the existing laws and future laws and not to the laws which are made before the commencement of the constitution. ​Article 13(2) states that all the laws which are made after the commencement of the Constitution are void to the extent of the infringement of the Fundamental Rights given in part 3 of the Constitution. The ‘Doctrine of Eclipse’ asserts that all the Pre-Constitutional laws which are against the fundamental rights of the Indian Constitution will become dormant and not dead. They will remain dormant as long as the state does not amend the law and its infringing nature. So this doctrine applies to only Article 13(1) of the Indian Constitution. In Keshavan Madhvan Menon v. State of Bombay , the court said that the law which is infringing the rights of the citizens after the commencement of the constitution is ‘void ab initio’ for the citizens of the country but it will remain enforceable for the non-citizens and companies. The doctrine of Eclipse makes the law unenforceable but it doesn’t make the law void ab initio. The ‘doctrine of Waiver’ means that a person who is receiving a right or a privilege can waive that right according to his will. Once the right is waived by the individual then they cannot claim it back. In Behram v. State of Bombay , it was decided by the court that the rights which are given in part 3 of the constitution cannot be waived by an individual. The ‘Doctrine of Separability’ means that if a part of a law is against the provisions of the constitution then only that offending part will be declared as void and not the whole statute. This doctrine is applied in both Article 13 (1) and Article 13 (2) of the Indian Constitution. In R.M.D.C. v. Union of India , AIR 1957, Supreme Court has given some rules relating to this doctrine: “1. It is important to understand the intention of the legislature before using this doctrine. 2. When separation of invalid part of the statute is very difficult then the whole law will be held as invalid. 3. If after deleting the invalid part, the valid part has no value left to it then the whole act will be rejected in its entirety.” Article 13(3) (a) defines “Law”. According to this section, Law includes any ordinance, order, bye-Law, rule, regulation, notification, custom or usages. This definition of law is given a wide meaning so that it can be added to a wide variety of state instrumentalities. In Ahmedabad Women Action Group v. Union of India , AIR 1977, Supreme Court said that personal laws (Hindu Law, Muslim Law, and Christian Law) are not part of the definition of Law under Article 13. The Bye-Laws made by the Cooperative Societies are also not part of the definition of Law. There have also been other discussions on whether “Law” includes constitutional amendments. ​This question was first decided in the case of Shankari Prasad v. Union of India AIR 1951. In that case, the Supreme Court held that the word law under Article 13(2) doesn’t include a constitutional amendment. This entailed that the Parliament has power to amend the Fundamental Rights according to their will. ​Later in the case of Golak Nath v. State of Punjab , AIR 1967, the Supreme Court overruled the Shankari Prasad verdict and stated that the word ‘Law’ in Article 13(2) includes the constitutional amendments. If any constitutional amendment is infringing the Fundamental rights then that amendment will be void. ​To nullify the Golak Nath decision the Parliament passed the 24th Amendment Act, 1971, wherein parliament added Clause 4 in Article 13 which stated that nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article 368. ​Later in the case of the Kesavananda Bharati v. the State of Kerala, AIR 1973, the constitutionality of the 24th Amendment was held valid. So the present position of the word “Law” is that a Constitutional Amendment does not include the word. This gives the Parliament the power to amend the provisions of the Fundamental rights as long as they align with the basic structure doctrine of the Indian Constitution.

Golaknath and Ors. vs State of Punjab and Anrs. The Supreme Court delivered its ruling, by a majority of 6-5 on 27 February 1967. The Court held that an amendment of the Constitution is a legislative process, and that an amendment under article 368 is ""law"" within the meaning of article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment ""takes away or abridges"" a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. Article 13(2) reads, ""The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of contravention, be void."" The Court also ruled that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a ""transcendental position"" under the Constitution and are kept beyond the reach of Parliament.

Explanation.—For the purposes of this article and article 16, ""economically weaker sections"" shall be such as may be notified by the State from time to time on the basis of family income and other indicators of economic disadvantage. [ Editorial Comment - Article 15 protects the citizens against various forms of discrimination based on religion and gender. The Constitution of India guarantees various rights to its citizens, including no discrimination on account of religion, race, caste, or place of birth. Article 15 restricts discrimination on the ground of: Religion – It means that no person should be discriminated against on the basis of religion from accessing any public place or policy by the state or any group. Race – Ethnic origin should not form a basis of discrimination. For example, a citizen of Afghan origin should not be discriminated against those of an Indian origin. Caste – Discrimination on the basis of caste is also prohibited to prevent atrocities on the lower castes by the upper caste. Sex – Gender of an individual shall not be a valid ground for discrimination in any matter. Place of birth – A place where an individual is born should not become a reason for discriminating among other members of the country. In the case of Kathi Raning Rawat v. State of Saurashtra , the state of Saurashtra set up special courts under Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance 1949, to adjudicate on the matters of section 302 , section 307 and section 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The contention brought before the court was that these provisions are discriminatory for the residents depending upon the territory. The court stated that all kinds of legislative differentiation are not discriminatory. The legislation did not refer to certain individual cases but to offenses of certain kinds committed in certain areas and hence it is not discrimination. In another significant case, John Vallamattom v. Union of India, AIR 2003 SC 2902 discussed that The Indian Succession Act 1925 prevented the petitioners from bequeathing property for religious and charitable purposes. The petitioner contended it to be discriminatory against the testamentary dispositions by a Christian. The court stated that the Act was to prevent people from making injudicious death-bed bequests under religious influence, but had a great impact on a person desiring to dispose of his property upon his death. Hence, the legislation is clearly discriminatory as the properties of any Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, Sikh, Jain or Parsi were excluded from the provisions of the Act. Further, no acceptable reasoning was provided to show why the provision regulates religious and charitable bequests of Christians alone. Clause 1 of the Article prohibits the State from discriminating against citizens on five protected grounds only. This means that if the discrimination is only on the basis of these 5 points then it will be void. One of the important points to remember under this clause is that the prohibition is against the state and not against any private individuals. This clause is used to give horizontal reservations like reservations for visually impaired people. The Supreme Court in D.P. Joshi v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1955 has made it clear that the place of birth and place of residence are two different things and States are allowed to differentiate on the basis of place of residence. In this case, the residents of the State were allowed exemption from paying the capitation fee. But the non-residents were asked to pay a capitation fee for admission in the medical college. This was held valid by the Supreme Court. Clause 2 discussed Access to Public Places. This clause gives access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of public entertainment to all. This clause also makes wells, tanks, bathing Ghats, roads and places of public resort accessible for every citizen. This clause is applied not only to the state but also against the individuals. It is illegal and unjust to restrict or prevent access to a public place established by the state exclusively for public use. Clause 3 discusses Special Provision for Women and Children. This clause is an exception to clause 1 and 2. This clause provides special preference to Women and Children as a matter of positive discrimination. It entails that nothing in this Article can stop the state from giving special preference to the Women and Children. In Revathi v. Union of India, AIR 1998 case, the court held that the word ‘for’ which is given under this clause means that states can give special preference to Women and Children in legislation.Clause 4 discusses Special Provisions for Backward Classes. This is the second exception of clause 1 and 2 of Article 15. This clause was not part of the original Constitution and was included through the 1st Constitutional Amendment. This clause makes special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens (SEBCs), Schedule Caste (SC) and Schedule Tribes (STs).​ In Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 , the government of Mysore set up a reservation of 68% of the total seats in Engineering and Medical colleges. These seats were reserved in the favor of SEBCs, STs and SCs. The court held that this legislation breached the limit of reservation which should not be more than 50% of the total seats. The court also stated that the backwardness must be both Social and Economical. It can’t be either social or economical alone. It was also held by the Supreme Court in A. Periakaruppan v. State of Tamil Nadu that classifying socially and educationally backward classes on the basis of caste was in violation of Article 15(4). According to the Court, it was, however, necessary for the conditions of such a class of people to change as that was the main reason for providing them with a reservation. Clause 5 discusses Reservation in Educational institutions. This is the 3rd Exception of Article 15. This exception was added by the 93rd Constitutional Amendment. This clause was added as a result of a Judgment of PA Inamdar and Ors. V. State of Maharashtra and Ors. In this judgment the court held that different states cannot impose its reservation policy on minority and non-minority unaided private colleges, including professional colleges. The validity of this act and 93rd Constitutional Amendment was challenged in Ashok Kumar Thakur v. Union of India (2008) Clause 6 lays down the Special Provisions for EWS category. This provision was added by the 103rd Constitutional amendment Act, 2019. This is the latest exception that provides for special provisions for the Economic Weaker Section (EWS). Several states have implemented schemes to enforce reservations for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) based on Clause (6). In 2021, the central government issued a notification to introduce EWS reservation in the medical postgraduate entrance exam. However, this decision was challenged in the Supreme Court.Multiple parties raised concerns about the constitutionality of the 103rd Amendment and brought the matter before the Supreme Court. They argued that it goes against the jurisprudence on reservations, which does not permit reservations solely based on economic criteria. On November 7, 2022, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court of India, in the case of Janhit Abhiyan v. Union of India, ruled that the 103rd Amendment does not violate the fundamental structure of the Constitution. Justices Maheshwari, Trivedi, and Pardiwala delivered separate judgments in favor of the majority, while Justice Bhat expressed a dissenting opinion on behalf of himself and Chief Justice U.U Lalit.

However, some states have chosen to implement the 10% reservation for economically weaker sections. Currently, the quota can be availed by persons with an annual gross household income of up to ₹8 lakh (US$10,000). Families that own over 5 acres of agricultural land, a house over 1,000 square feet, a plot of over 100-yards in a notified municipal area or over a 200-yards plot in a non-notified municipal area cannot avail the reservation. Persons belonging to communities that already have reservations such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the ""non creamy layer"" of Other Backward Classes are also not eligible for reservation under this quota(creamy layer of OBC crosses 8 lakh limit).

Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment (1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State, (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or office under the State. (3) Nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law prescribing, in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an officeunder the Government of, or any local or other authority within, a State or Union territory, any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to such employment or appointment. (4) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State. (4A) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class or classes of posts in the services under the State in favour of Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of State are not adequately represented in the services under the State. [In article 16 of the Constitution after clause 4, the following clauses shall be inserted through Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Seventy-seventh Amendment) Act, 1995, broadened the reservation provisions for job promotions, encompassing individuals belonging to Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Since 1955, the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) have had access to the facility of reservation in the promotion. However, the Supreme Court stated in its decision dated November 16, 1992, in the issue of Indra Sawhney and Others vs. Union of India and Others that reservation of appointments or posts under Article 16(4) of the Constitution is restricted to initial appointment. Further, it cannot extend to a reservation in matters of promotion. The interests of the SC and STs will be harmed by this Supreme Court decision. It is vital to continue the current dispensation of offering reservations in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes since their representation in services in the States has not achieved the requisite level. The government has chosen to maintain the prevailing policy of reservations in the promotion of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in light of its commitment to safeguarding the interests of these groups. To achieve this, it is necessary to change Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. This is accomplished by adding a new clause (4A) to the aforementioned article that establishes a reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs). Also refer ] [ Editorial comment -The primary goal of the Constitution (Eighty-fifth Amendment) Act, 2002, was to increase the benefits of reservation in favor of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class. The phrase 'in situations of promotion to any class' was replaced with 'in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, to any class' in clause (4A) of Article 16 of the Indian Constitution. Also Refer ] [In article 16 of the Constitution after clause 4 (A), the following clauses shall be inserted through Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000] (4B) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause (4) or clause (4A) as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cent, reservation on total number of vacancies of that year. [The Constitution (Eighty-first Amendment) Act, 2000, aimed to protect reservations for SCs and STs in the backlog of vacancies. A new clause (4B) was added to Article 16 of the Constitution of India by the 81st Amendment Act of 2000, after clause (4A). This gave the states the authority to treat unfilled reserved vacancies from one year as a separate class of vacancies to be filled in the following year or years. The new provision stated that such vacancies must not be included in the vacancies of the year in which they are filled, in order to calculate the overall vacancy reservation ceiling of 50% for that year. This modification essentially eliminated the 50% cap on reservations for backlog vacancies. Also Refer ] (5) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent of an office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any member of the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to a particular denomination. (6) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any economically weaker sections of citizens other than the classes mentioned in clause (4), in addition to the existing reservation and subject to a maximum of ten per cent. of the posts in each category. Editorial Comment - Article 16 discusses equality in opportunity of employment for all the citizens. There are 6 Clauses under this article. Starting clause 1 and 2 talks about equality of Opportunity and clause 3 to 6 are the exceptions of clause 1 and 2. Clause 1 states that there shall be equal opportunity for the citizens in the matter of employment or appointment to any office under the State. This clause does not provide the right to employment; it only gives the right to equal opportunity in case of any available vacancy in public employment. This clause also applies to promotions or termination and other aspects of state employment. This equality is applied only to the people who are applying for the same employment opportunity or are working in the same post. Clause 2 states that there will be no discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence in employment. The state cannot discriminate only on the basis of the above criterias. It is stated in clause 3 of Article 16 that nothing in this article shall prevent Parliament from making any law which prescribes to the citizens who are appointed to any office under the State in regard to any requirements as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to employment or appointment to any office under the State. Article 16(4) of the Indian constitution provides for the reservation of services under the State in favor of the backward class of citizens. Backward class includes Schedule Castes and Scheduled Tribes. In the case of Balaji v. State of Mysore, AIR 1963 the court held that caste cannot be the sole determining criteria for gauging the backwardness of a community. It can be their Poverty or the place where they live also. In the case of T. Devadashan v. Union of India, AIR 1964 , the court struck down the carry forward rule for the vacancies of backward classes. The Court held that, following Balaji, the reserve vacancies in any one year had risen to more than 50% because they were not constitutional because of the carry-forward clause. The 50% rule only applies to proper reservations, i.e., backward classes reservations made under Article 16(4). The law cannot be applied to exemptions, concessions, or reliefs given to retroactive classes in compliance with Article 16(4). In the landmark judgment, Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, AIR 1993 (Mandal case), the Supreme Court dealt with the issue of “carry forward” reservations. The Second Backward Classes Committee, headed by BP Mandal, submitted its report which recommended 27 percent reservation for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and 22.5 percent for the Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes. The Central government, however, acted on the report a decade later, by issuing an office memorandum (OM), providing 27 percent vacancies for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes to be filled by direct recruitment. Indra Sawhney, the petitioner in this case, made three principal arguments against the Order- The extension of reservation violated the Constitutional guarantee of equality of opportunity, caste was not a reliable indicator of backwardness and that the efficiency of public institutions was at risk. The Supreme Court upheld the government order that caste was an acceptable indicator of backwardness. Thus, the recommendation of reservations for OBCs in central government services was finally implemented in 1992. The Supreme Court states that 27% central government reservation for OBCs is valid. However, some states denied the existence of the creamy layer, and a report commissioned by the supreme court was implemented. The case was pressed again in 1999 and the supreme court reaffirmed the creamy layer exclusion and extended it to SCs and STs. This judgment also overruled Rangachar v. General Manager Southern Railway and Akhil Bharatiya Soshit Karamchari Sangh (Railway) v. Union of India verdicts, which said that reservations could be made in promotions as well as appointments. Indra Sawhney v. Union of India held that reservations cannot be applied in promotions. Later, the Parliament enacted the 77th Amendment Act, 1995 and added clause (4A) to Article 16 of the Constitution, thereby enabling the Parliament to make provisions for reservation for SCs and STs in promotion posts. This simply meant that even after the judgment of mandal case, the reservation in promotion in government jobs, shall continue. Clause (4B) was added to the Indian Constitution by way of 81st Amendment Act, 2000. It was added to the Constitution with the intent that the backlog vacancies which could not be filled due to unavailability of eligible candidates of the SEBC category in a previous or preceding year, shall not be clubbed with the 50 percent reservation for the SCs and STs and Other Backward Classes on the total number of vacancies in the next year. Clause (5) exempts a law from the application of clauses (1) and (2), which require the incumbent of any office to be religiously qualified for appointment. The case M. Nagaraj v. Union of India dealt with Articles 16 (4A) and (4B) of the Constitution. It was held in this case that in order to grant reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, the State must collect ‘quantifiable data’ to demonstrate their backwardness. It was held that the concept of the creamy layer will also apply to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and therefore, they would not be entitled to any such reservations. Further, the decision was altered as it was argued by the Attorney-General of India that both the holdings were incorrect as they were contrary to the judgment which was given in Indra Sawhney v. Union of India (non-exclusion of creamy layer in matters of reservations). Clause (6) was added to Article 16 by the 103rd Amendment Act, 2019, which came into effect on January 14, 2019, and empowers the State to make various provisions for reservation in appointments of members of the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) of society to government posts. However, these provisions must be within the 10% ceiling, in addition to the existing reservations. In the case of Janhit Abhiyan v. Union of India (2022) the constitutionality of the 103rd Amendment was contested, alleging that it violated the fundamental structure of the Indian Constitution. However, the majority decision, with a 3:2 ratio, upheld the amendment as constitutionally valid. Justice Maheshwari explained that reservations go beyond being mere affirmative actions or measures to address social and educational backwardness; instead, they serve to combat various forms of disadvantages. The majority also ruled that a 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) in addition to the existing 50% reservation limit, as established in the Indra Sawhney Case, is constitutional. Additionally, all three judges agreed that the 50% limit is not rigid and may be surpassed in exceptional circumstances. References Social Laws Today IndianKanoon News Article Blog Ipleaders",,,,

     [Constitution]","17. Abolition of untouchability ""Untouchability"" is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of ""Untouchability"" shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. Editorial Comment - The Indian Constitution, specifically Article 17, has abolished the practice of untouchability in all its forms. This article explicitly declares the prohibition of untouchability. Furthermore, the Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 (renamed as the Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976) considers the practice of untouchability as a criminal offense, and individuals engaging in such practices are subject to legal punishment. According to this Act, anything accessible to the general public should be equally accessible to all Indian citizens.​ Article 17 is a very important part of the Right to Equality. It not only provides equality but also social justice. Also the Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 ​led to the establishment of special courts to decide the cases related to the commission of offenses under this act. Section 18 of this Act makes the commission of offenses under this Act a non-bailable offense. In Jai Singh v. Union of India Rajasthan High Court and in Devrajiah v. B. Padmana of Madras High Court, the court defined the word untouchability.The court said that ‘The subject matter of Article 17 is not untouchable in its literal or grammatical sense but the ‘practice as it had developed historically in the country’. It refers to the social disabilities imposed on certain classes of persons because of their birth in certain castes. Hence, it does not cover the social boycott of a few individuals or their exclusion from religious services, etc. In the case of People’s Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1982 the Supreme Court held that when the rights under Article 17 are violated by any private individual then it will be the responsibility of the state to take action immediately. Merely because the aggrieved person could themself protect or enforce their invaded fundamental rights, did not absolve the State from its constitutional obligations. In State of Karnataka v. Appa Balu Ingale , the Supreme Court expressing its concern on the continuance of the practice of untouchability, held that it was an indirect form of slavery is only extension of the caste system. In this case, the accusation against the respondents was that they had forcibly restrained the complainant from taking water from a newly dug-up borewell because they were untouchable.

     [Constitution]","18. Abolition of titles (1) No title, not being a military or academic distinction, shall be conferred by the State. (2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. (3) No person who is not a citizen of India shall, while he holds any office of profit or trust under the State, accept without the consent of the President any title from any foreign State. (4) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the consent of the President, accept any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign State. Editorial Comment - Article 18(1) of the Indian Constitution abolishes all titles and prohibits the state from conferring titles on any individual, whether they are a citizen or a non-citizen. However, military and academic distinctions are exceptions to this prohibition. This means that universities, for instance, can grant titles or honors to individuals based on their merit. Article 18(2) specifically prohibits Indian citizens from accepting titles from foreign states. Article 18(3) states that non-citizens holding positions of profit or trust under the Indian State require the President's consent to accept titles from foreign states. Additionally, Article 18(4) stipulates that no person, whether a citizen or a non-citizen, holding a position of profit or trust, can accept any gifts, salary, or office from a foreign state without the President's consent. Clauses (3) and (4) aim to ensure the loyalty of non-citizens towards the Indian State and prevent any breach of trust. A ""title"" refers to an attachment to one's name, such as a prefix or suffix (e.g., Sir, Nawab, Maharaja). In a democracy, the creation of titles and titular glories is discouraged as it goes against the principles of social equality. However, it is argued that titles like ""Bharat Ratna,"" ""Padma Vibhushan,"" and ""Padma Shri"" (introduced in 1954) are not prohibited under Article 18 because they signify state recognition of exceptional work by citizens in various fields. It is important to note that Article 18 does not confer any fundamental right but rather imposes restrictions on executive and legislative powers. The conferral of titles is seen as contrary to the fundamental principle of equality guaranteed by Article 14, which ensures equal treatment of all citizens. In the landmark judgment Balaji Raghavan v. Union of India , AIR 1996, the court held that National awards aren’t titles under clause 1 of Article 18. A committee (High Level Review Committee: chaired by the Vice-President) was set up by the Government in which it states that the awards should be given based on recommendations of names given by various state governments. These recommendations will be reviewed by the Centre government. After this committee, the names will be sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and finally sent to the President for the final verdict. It is important to remember that there are no guidelines given for the Bharat Ratna award. ​ In the case of Indira Jaising v. Supreme Court of India (2017) , a complaint was lodged in this matter questioning the usage of the term ‘senior advocate’ before the names of the advocates. The Supreme Court ruled that this is not the title, but rather a demarcation, and therefore does not violate Article 18 of the Indian Constitution.

[ Editorial Comment - Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India guarantees six fundamental freedoms to every citizen of India. Though all of these six Fundamental Freedoms are not absolute. They contain certain restraints and exceptions within them which are postulated in Article 19(2) to 19(6). Freedom of Speech and Expression - Article 19(1)(a) grants citizens the right to freely express their thoughts, opinions, and ideas. This includes the freedom to express oneself through speech, writing, printing, visual representations, or any other means. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right for the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign nations, public order, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation, incitement to an offense, or the sovereignty and integrity of Parliament. The first set of grounds, namely, the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States and public order are all grounds referable to national interest. Whereas the second set of grounds, namely, decency or morality, contempt of court, defamation and incitement to an offense are all concerned with the interest of the society. However it is the constitutional obligation of the judiciary to ensure that the restrictions imposed by a law on the media are reasonable and relate to the purposes specified in Article 19(2).Because reasonable restrictions contemplated under the Indian Constitution brings the matter in the domain of the court as the question of reasonableness is a question primarily for the Court to decide. Freedom of speech and expression is a crucial right which is recognized by Article 19(l)(a), It has been held to be a basic and indivisible right for a democratic polity. In Romesh Thappar v. State of Madras ,Patanjali Shastri, C.J. observed:“Freedom of speech and of the press lay at the foundation of all democratic organizations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the process of popular government, is possible”The expression ‘Freedom of press’ is part of the ambit of article 19 and it means the right to print and publish without any interference from the state or any other public authority. But this Freedom, like other freedoms, cannot be absolute but is subject to well known exceptions acknowledged in the public interests, which in India are enumerated in Article 19(2) of the constitution. Thus, in Prabhu Dutt v. Union of India the Supreme Court has held that the right to know news and information regarding administration of the Government is included in the freedom of press. But this right is not absolute and restrictions can be imposed on it in the interest of the society and the individual from which the press obtains information. They can obtain information from an individual when he voluntarily agrees to give such information. In Bennett Coleman & Co v. Union of India (1972), the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the freedom of the press embodies the right of the people to free speech and expression. It was held that “Freedom of the press is both qualitative and quantitative. Freedom lies both in circulation and in content.” In the case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, 2015 Section 66A of the Information Technology Act was challenged. Under this section, there were several arrests which were made due to which a wide outrage was seen in society. The petitioners said that this Article is infringing the Freedom of Speech and Expression. The Supreme Court stroked down this provision saying that this provision is too vague and prone to misuse. In the State of U.P. v. Raj Narain (1975) , the Supreme Court observed that the right to know is derived from the concept of freedom of speech. The Court further held that the people of this country have a right to know every public act, everything that is done in a public way, by their public functionaries. Right to speak includes the right to not speak or the right to remain silent. In Bijoe Emmanuel v. State of Kerala (1986) , the Supreme Court upheld the right to silence of three students who were expelled from school because they refused to sing the National Anthem. The Court held that no person can be compelled to sing the National Anthem if he has genuine conscientious objections based on his religious belief. Hence, the right to speak and the right to express includes the right not to express and to be silent. Freedom to Assemble Peacefully - Article 19(1)(b) ensures the right to peacefully assemble and hold public meetings or processions without arms. This right allows citizens to come together for various purposes, such as protests, demonstrations, or discussions. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, sovereignty, and integrity of India. In Himmat Lal v. Police Commissioner, Bombay (1972) , the Supreme Court struck down a rule that empowered the police commissioner to impose a total ban on all public meetings and processions. It was held that the state could only make regulations in aid of the right of assembly of citizens and could impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of public order but no rule could be prescribed prohibiting all meetings or processions altogether. Freedom to Form Associations or Unions -  Article 19(1)(c) guarantees the right to form associations or unions. Citizens have the freedom to form social, cultural, economic, or political associations or unions. This right allows individuals to collectively pursue common goals or interests. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, morality, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In Damyanti v. Union of India (1971), the Supreme Court upheld the right of the members of an association to continue the association with its composition as voluntarily agreed upon by the persons forming the association. Freedom to Move Freely -  Article 19(1)(d) ensures the right to move freely throughout the territory of India. Citizens have the liberty to move within the country, reside in any part of India, and settle in any place of their choice. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, security of the State, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In Chambara soy v. Union of India (2007), some persons had blocked a road due to which the petitioner was delayed in taking his ailing son to the hospital and his son died on arrival at the hospital. The Supreme Court held that the right of the petitioner to move freely under Article 19(1)(d) has been violated due to the road blockage. The Court held that the State is liable to pay the compensation for the death of the petitioner’s son due to the inaction on the part of the State authorities in removing the aforesaid blockage. Freedom to Reside and Settle - Article 19(1)(e) guarantees the right to reside and settle in any part of India. Citizens have the freedom to choose their place of residence and settle anywhere within the country. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of public order, protection of scheduled tribes, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In the case of U.P. Avas Evam Vikas Parishad v. Friends Co-op. Housing Society Ltd.(1995) , it was held by the Supreme Court that the right to residence under Article 19(1)(e) includes the right to shelter and to construct houses for that purpose. Freedom to Practice Profession, Occupation, Trade, or Business -  Article 19(1)(g) provides the right to practice any profession, occupation, trade, or business. Citizens have the freedom to choose and engage in their preferred livelihoods. However, reasonable restrictions can be imposed on this right in the interests of the general public, professional qualifications, or the sovereignty and integrity of India. In the landmark judgment, Chindamanrao v. State of M.P. (AIR 1951) , the Central Provinces imposed a ban on the making of Bidis during the Agricultural Seasons. The manufacturing of Bidis used to work as an additional income for the women of the local area. So the act by the government of the Central province was challenged in the Supreme Court. Court decided that the act made by the government is arbitrary and does not fall under the reasonable restrictions. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997) has observed that the sexual harassment of working women in workplaces violates the fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g). In this case, comprehensive guidelines and binding directions were issued by the court to prevent the incidents of sexual harassment of women at workplaces in both public and private sectors. ] References IndianKanoon ConstitutionofIndia.net Blog Ipleaders Legal Service India Wikipedia [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Sixteenth Amendment) Act, 1963, it amended the Clauses (2), (3), and (4) of Article 19. This was done to enable the state to make laws that, in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India, place reasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of the rights conferred by sub-clauses (a), (b), and (c) of clause 1 of the article.] [ Editorial comment -The Constitution (Ninety-seventh Amendment) Act, 2011,was proposed to overcome the difficulties faced by Cooperative societies and improve their performance and status in the country. The extensive establishment of cooperatives was envisioned as one of the attempts to achieve social and economic justice and the equitable distribution of the advantages of progress. According to this Amendment, these societies are given constitutional status and are legally protected while also maintaining their autonomous or democratic functioning. The Constitution was amended to require that the states guarantee the autonomy of cooperatives, and as a result, state governments are now required to support the voluntary formation, autonomous decision-making, democratic control, and operation of cooperatives. The Act witnessed many changes such as modification in Part III of Article 19(1)(c) with the insertion of the words “or co-operative societies”, and the addition of Article 43B (working towards enhancing the co-Operative Societies’ Voluntary formation, independent operation, and professional management) and Part IX B to the Indian Constitution. However, the 97th Amendment faced challenges in the High Court of Gujarat as the Parliament didn’t ask for approval from the state legislatures before passing the bill. The ratification/approval is necessary for matters concerning states and since the cooperative societies are a part of the state legislature, ratification was required. On July 20, 2021, the Supreme Court of India declared the 97th Amendment Act Unconstitutional. According to the Supreme Court ratification from states was necessary to pass the amendment which didn’t take place. The Supreme Court also said that the responsibility of Multistate Co-Operative societies is of the Centre while that of the State co-operative societies is of the state. As of the current scenario,  parts of the 97th Amendment on cooperatives are struck down.

     [Constitution]","20. Protection in respect of conviction for offences (1) No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence. (2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once. (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself. Editorial Comment - Article 20 of the Indian Constitution safeguards certain rights in criminal proceedings. It provides protection against self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and retrospective punishment. Article 20(1) prohibits the imposition of retrospective punishment. It states that no person shall be punished for an act that was not an offense at the time it was committed. This provision ensures that individuals cannot be held accountable for actions that were legal when they occurred but were later made illegal by subsequent legislation. In the landmark judgment, Kedar Nath v. State of West Bengal the Supreme Court held that when an act is declared a criminal offense by the legislature and provides penalties for it, such declaration is always prospective and cannot be applied retrospectively as per the provisions of Article 20(1) However, it is important to note that this clause prohibits only the procedure of sentencing and convicting, not the trial itself. Therefore, a person accused under a particular procedure cannot claim protection under this clause or the doctrine of ex post facto law. In the case of Mohan Lal v. State of Rajasthan involving the Narcotics, Drugs, and Psychotropic Substances Act, the court opined that Article 20 prohibits only conviction and punishment under an ex post facto law, not the trial or prosecution itself. Furthermore, a trial conducted under a different procedure from the one existing at the time of the offense does not fall within the scope of this provision and cannot be deemed unconstitutional. In another significant judgment, Maru Ram Etc. v. Union Of India & Anr (1980 AIR 2147) , the Court observed that Article 20(1) also encompasses the principle that penalties for an offense should not be retrospectively increased beyond what existed at the time of the offense. However, there is an exception to the restriction imposed by this provision. In the case of Rattan Lal v. The State of Punjab , the Supreme Court allowed for retrospective application of criminal laws in situations where the issue at hand concerns the reduction of punishment for the said offense. Article 20(2) prohibits a person from being prosecuted and punished for the same offense more than once. This principle of double jeopardy prevents individuals from being subjected to multiple trials or punishments for the same offense. Once a person has been acquitted or convicted and punished for a particular offense, they cannot be tried or punished again for the same offense. In the case of Venkataraman v. Union of India , the Supreme Court of India established that this provision deals exclusively with Judicial punishments and provides that no person is prosecuted twice by the judicial authorities. The most crucial landmark judgement came in the case of Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay , where the person accused was possessing some amount of gold, which was against lex loci at the time and gold was confiscated by the customs authority. And, later when the person was prosecuted before a criminal court, the court was confronted with the question whether this amounts to Double Jeopardy. But, the Supreme Court observed that departmental proceedings, i.e. by Customs Authority, in this case, doesn’t amount to trial by a judicial tribunal, thus the proceedings before the criminal court is not barred in this case and the proceedings can go on. In a nutshell Departmental Proceedings are independent of trial by a judicial court or tribunal. However, the prosecution may happen if the facts are distinct in subsequent proceedings. Same was established by the Supreme Court of India in case of A.A. Mulla v. State of Maharashtra and was observed that; Article 20 (2) would not be attracted in those cases where the facts are distinct in subsequent offence or punishment. Article 20(3) ensures that no person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against themselves. This means that an individual cannot be forced to provide evidence or testimony that may incriminate themselves. It is a fundamental right that protects individuals from being compelled to be witnesses in their own criminal prosecution. Prohibition against self-incrimination could only be put into effect if the person is accused of a criminal offence. This doctrine could not be invoked for cases other than criminal cases. Also, as held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Raja Narayanlal Bansilal vs Maneck Phiroz Mistry , to claim the immunity from being self-incriminated, there must exist a formal accusation against the person and mere general inquiry and investigation don’t form grounds for the same. These safeguards provided under Article 20 are essential components of a fair and just legal system. They uphold the principles of fairness, protection against self-incrimination, and the prevention of arbitrary or excessive punishment. It's important to note that these protections are applicable in criminal proceedings and serve as a shield against certain violations of individual rights. However, reasonable restrictions and limitations can be imposed in the interests of public order, security of the State, or the proper administration of justice.

     [Constitution]","21. Protection of life and personal liberty No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law. Editorial Comment - Article 21 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to protection of life and personal liberty. It ensures certain safeguards against arbitrary deprivation of life and liberty. Article 21 asserts that no person shall be deprived of their life except according to the procedure established by law. This means that every individual has the right to live, and their life cannot be taken away except in accordance with the prescribed legal procedures. The right to life encompasses various aspects, including the right to live with dignity, the right to livelihood, and the right to a healthy environment. Article 21 also protects the personal liberty of individuals. It states that no person shall be deprived of their personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. Personal liberty includes the freedom to move freely, the freedom to choose one's place of residence, and the freedom to engage in any lawful occupation or profession. ​In the landmark judgment, A.K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras , the Supreme Court held that personal liberty means the “liberty of the body” which is freedom from arrest and detention from false detention. The Supreme Court added that the meaning of the word ‘law’ means state made law only. So clearly this was a narrow interpretation of the word Personal freedom and Law. ​But in later cases, this view was redressed by the Judiciary. In the case of R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (1970) the court held that the word personal liberty would not only include Article 21 but also includes the 6 Fundamental Freedoms given under Article 19 (1). ​In the case of Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1963, the court adopted a wider meaning of personal liberty and said that it will include all the rights which are given under Article 19(1). In the landmark judgment Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978), Supreme Court held that the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 is not limited to mere animal existence but includes the right to live with dignity. The court emphasized that the procedure established by law must be fair, just, and reasonable, and it cannot be arbitrary, oppressive, or unreasonable. In Olga Tellis v. Bombay Municipal Corporation (1985), the court recognized the right to livelihood as an integral part of the right to life under Article 21. It held that the eviction of pavement dwellers without providing alternative arrangements would violate their right to life and personal liberty. In the landmark judgment, Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997), the supreme court addressed the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace. The court held that the right to a safe and secure working environment is a fundamental right flowing from Article 21. It laid down guidelines to prevent and redress sexual harassment at workplaces until appropriate legislation was enacted. In, National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and Ors (2014) , ​The National Legal Services Authority filed a PIL to protect the interests of transgendered persons. The court held that the Gender of a person is to be decided by the person themself after looking into the Right to Life Article. So all the rights which are given to normal people must be given to transgendered people like Public toilets, medical care for transgendered persons and the provisions of reservations under Article 15 and 16 must be extended to them as they classify as a minority section. In the case, Animal Welfare Board v. A. Nagaraja (2014) , rights which are given to animals were up for contention (especially bulls used in Jallikattu festival). In this case, the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI) brought the attention of the court towards the cruelty and inhuman behavior which is faced by the animals which are used in the Jallikattu festival. ​ The court held that they have a duty under the doctrine of ‘parens patriae’ to take care of the rights of animals. Article 51A (g) of the Constitution also gives the principle of compassion towards living beings and animals. So under this case, the Supreme Court ruled that Jallikattu is constitutionally void. In another landmark judgment, K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017) (privacy judgment) the Supreme Court recognized the right to privacy as a fundamental right protected under Article 21. The court held that privacy is an essential aspect of personal liberty and dignity and is intrinsic to the entire constitutional scheme. In Common Cause v. Union of India (2018) , the court legalized passive euthanasia and recognized the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21. The court held that individuals have the right to refuse medical treatment or life support and can make an advance directive specifying their wishes in case of terminal illness. Article 21 also prohibits arbitrary or unlawful detention. It ensures that no person can be detained without proper legal justification or without following the due process of law. It safeguards against arbitrary arrests and protects individuals from being unlawfully deprived of their freedom. It also encompasses the right to a fair trial. It guarantees that every person accused of an offense shall have the right to a fair and impartial trial, including the right to legal representation, the right to be heard, and the right to present evidence in their defense. In the case, A.K. Roy v. Union of India (AIR 1982) (NSA case), the Supreme Court discussed whether the provisions of Natural Justice should be applied to the National Security act or not. This Act took away many important rights of a detained person like Right to be represented by a lawyer, Right to cross-examine the detaining authority etc. The court held that Natural justice is important but it cannot be applied in all the acts. It is important to look at the circumstances and the purpose of making the Act. So based on this logic the court upheld the NSA Act (1980). The interpretation and scope of Article 21 have evolved through various landmark judgments of the Supreme Court, expanding its ambit to include protection against torture, custodial violence, and the right to a clean and healthy environment. It's important to note that reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the rights guaranteed under Article 21 in the interests of public order, national security, public health, or morality. However, such restrictions must be fair, just, and in accordance with the principles of reasonableness and proportionality.

They have the right to know the reasons behind their arrest, enabling them to effectively exercise their legal rights. Preventive Detention - Article 22 also addresses the issue of preventive detention, which allows the authorities to detain individuals for preventive reasons, such as the maintenance of public order or national security. It imposes certain additional safeguards, such as the requirement for the grounds of detention to be communicated and the provision for a review by an advisory board. It's important to note that Article 22 provides certain exceptions during times of emergency, such as during a proclamation of Emergency by the President of India. In such circumstances, certain restrictions on the rights and safeguards under Article 22 may be imposed. In the case, D.K. Basu v. State of West Bengal (1997) , ​ A Public Interest Litigation was filed by Dr Dilip Kumar Basu related to a case of Custodial violence.

Prohibition of traffic in human beings and forced labour (1) Traffic in human beings and beggar and other similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any contravention of this provision shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. (2) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for public purpose, and in imposing such service the State shall not make any discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste or class or any of them. Editorial Comment - Article 23 of the Indian Constitution addresses the prohibition of trafficking in human beings and forced labor. Article 23 prohibits trafficking in human beings, including trafficking for the purpose of forced labor, slavery, or exploitation. It recognizes the inherent dignity and rights of individuals, ensuring protection against such practices. It also prohibits forced labor or any form of compulsory labor. It ensures that no person can be compelled to work against their will or under exploitative conditions. The prohibition on forced labor does not apply to work required as a part of a compulsory service for public purposes, such as military service, or in cases of emergency or calamity threatening the life or well-being of the community. Article 23 emphasizes the importance of protecting individual freedom and dignity, ensuring that no person is subjected to exploitation or degrading conditions of work. It safeguards the right to receive fair and reasonable remuneration for work done. The objective of Article 23 is to eradicate practices that exploit and subjugate individuals, particularly vulnerable sections of society. It upholds the principles of equality, justice, and respect for human rights. It's important to note that to address the issues related to trafficking, forced labor, and other forms of exploitation, the Indian government has enacted specific laws such as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act , Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act , and other relevant legislation to provide legal frameworks and mechanisms for preventing and combating such offenses. In, Sanjit Roy v. The State of Rajasthan, AIR 1983, court held that payment of wages which is lower than the minimum wage to a person who is working in famine relief work is against the provisions of Article 23.

Prohibition of employment of children in factories, etc. No child below the age of fourteen years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. Editorial Comment - Article 24 of the Indian Constitution pertains to the prohibition of child labor. It aims to protect the rights and welfare of children by prohibiting their employment in certain hazardous occupations or processes. Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in any factory, mine, or hazardous occupation. The intention is to prevent exploitation, safeguard the health and development of children, and ensure their access to education. The article allows for certain exceptions where child labor may be permitted, such as engaging children in non-hazardous family-based work, work as part of a school's curriculum, or in any other harmless or innocent occupation. This article also empowers the government to enact legislation to determine the specific occupations and processes that are considered hazardous for children. The government has the authority to impose necessary restrictions and regulations to enforce this provision effectively. Article 24 is closely linked to Article 21A, which guarantees the right to education for children between the ages of 6 and 14 years. By prohibiting child labor, Article 24 promotes the realization of the right to education and ensures that children have the opportunity to develop their potential and skills through proper schooling. In this landmark case, M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1997) , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of child labor in the firecracker industry. The court prohibited the employment of children in hazardous industries, including the manufacture of firecrackers. It emphasized the importance of enforcing Article 24 to protect the rights and welfare of children and directed the government to take necessary measures to eradicate child labor. In People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982) , The Supreme Court dealt with the issue of child labor in matchbox factories. The court recognized that child labor in hazardous industries was a violation of their fundamental rights. It held that the prohibition on child labor under Article 24 must be effectively enforced to ensure the well-being and development of children. In Bachpan Bachao Andolan v. Union of India (2011) , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of child labor in various industries, including carpet weaving. The court reiterated the importance of implementing and enforcing the provisions of Article 24 to eradicate child labor and protect the rights of children.

Explanation II.—In sub-clause (b) of clause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion, and the reference to Hindu religious institutions shall be construed accordingly. Editorial Comment - Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of religion. It encompasses various aspects related to the freedom to profess, practice, and propagate religion. The freedom of religion under this article is subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the interest of public order, morality, and health. This means that while individuals have the right to practice their religion, it should not disrupt the harmony of society or infringe upon the well-being of others. Article 25 distinguishes between religious practices and secular activities associated with religious institutions. The state has the authority to regulate or restrict secular activities that may be associated with religious practices, such as social reforms, economic activities, and other activities unrelated to the core aspects of religion. It also includes the right of religious denominations or any section thereof to manage their own religious affairs, including establishing and maintaining religious institutions, as long as they do not violate any other laws or public order. ​In the case of Vaishno Devi Shrine, Board v. State of Jammu and Kashmir, AIR 1997 , In this case, the validity of Jammu and Kashmir Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Act, 1988 was challenged. This act was made for better management and governance of the temple. This act was challenged based on a violation of the Fundamental right of Religion of the petitioner. It abolished the hereditary post of the priests and gave the power to the state to make the appointment of priests. The Supreme Court held that the service of a priest is a secular activity and it can be regulated by the state under clause 2 of Article 25. In the case, Sardar Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb v. State of Bombay (1962) , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of religious freedom and held that the freedom to manage religious affairs includes the right to determine the essential practices of a religious denomination. The court emphasized that the state should not interfere in matters of religious faith unless such practices are considered immoral or contrary to public order. In the case, Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt (1954) , Supreme Court dealt with the power of the state to intervene in the administration of religious institutions. The Supreme Court held that while the state can regulate and supervise the administration of religious institutions, it should not interfere with the essential religious practices and customs of a denomination unless they are deemed to be socially harmful or against public order. In the case of Acharya Jadishwaranand Avadhuta v. Commissioner of Police, Calcutta, 1984 (Anand Marga Case), the Supreme Court held that the Tandava dance which is followed by the community of Anand Marga is not an essential part of the religion. So an order can be passed for the prohibition of Tandava dance in public and it will not violate Article 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution. ​In the case of Moulana Mufti Sayeed Mohd. Norrur Rehman Barkariq v. State of West Bengal, AIR 1999 , the High Court said that the restriction imposed by the state on the use of Microphones and loudspeakers at the time of Azaan is not against the Article 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution. In the case, Shyam Narayan Chouksey v. Union of India, the Supreme Court dealt with the question of showing respect to the national anthem. The Supreme Court held that every citizen or persons are bound to show respect to the National Anthem of India, whenever played or sung on specific occasions the only exemption is granted to disabled people. It further held that playing of the national anthem in cinema halls is not mandatory but optional and directory. In the case, Shayara Bano v. Union of India (Triple Talaq case), a 5 judges bench of the Supreme Court discussed whether the practice of Talaq-e-biddat (triple talaq) is a matter of faith to the Muslims and whether it is constituent to their personal law. By a 3:2 majority, the court ruled that the practice of Talaq-e-biddat is illegal and unconstitutional. The court also held that an injunction would continue to bar the Muslim male from practicing triple talaq till a legislation is enacted for that purpose.

Editorial Comment - ​Article 26 provides for the freedom to manage the religious affairs of the citizens and is subject to Public order, morality and health. Article 26(a)  Right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes.The right to establish and maintain religious institutions is given to every religious institution. The word establishes and maintains must be read together. So it is important for a religious institution to first establish a religious institution and only then the right to maintain an institution is to be given to that group. It is to be noted that the right to maintain an institution will also include the right to administer it. In the case of TMA Pai Foundation v. The State of Karnataka , AIR 2003, the court held that the right to establish and maintain a religious institution is given to every religion. It can be a majority religion or even a minority religion. Article 26(b) Right to manage its own affairs in matters of religion. Every religious institution has the right to manage its own affairs in the matters of religion. The State has got no right to interfere in these matters unless it is affecting the public order, morality and health of the citizens. In the case of S.P. Mittal v. Union of India , AIR 1983, the validity of the Aurobindo (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1980 was challenged on the ground that it was violative of their right to freedom of religion. Sri Aurobindo founded the philosophy of cosmic salvation. He and his disciples formed the Aurobindo Society. The court decided that the sayings of Sri Aurobindo were not religious institutions. So the taking over of the Aurobindo Ashram by the Government did not infringe Article 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution. Article 26(c) details the right to own and acquire movable and immovable property. The state can regulate the property of a religious denomination by law. Article 26(d) is on the right to administer such property in accordance with law. The State can regulate the administration of the property belonging to the religious entity. It is also important to understand that the state cannot altogether take away the right of the administration from the religious institution. ​In the case of Seshammal v. State of Tamil Nadu , 1972, the hereditary post of Archakas and Mathadhipatis of Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu challenged the validity of Tamil Nadu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1970 under Article 32 on the violation of Right to Freedom. The Supreme Court decided that the post of Archaka is secular. The appointment of Archaka is not a religious practice nor is it an integral part of a religion. So the court upheld the appointment of Archakas according to prevailing usage and custom. The right to succession also remained valid. ​In the case of N. Adithayan v. Travancore Devaswom Board , 2002, it was challenged if non-Brahmins can be appointed as a pujari in a temple. The Supreme Court held that the Brahmins do not have the monopoly over-performing puja in a temple. The court also added that non-Brahmins can be appointed as a pujari as long as he is well versed in his job. References IndianKanoon Wikipedia Blog Ipleaders",,,,

     [Constitution]","27. Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. Editorial Comment - Article 27 ensures that individuals are not forced to contribute through taxes towards the promotion or maintenance of any specific religion or religious denomination. It upholds the principle of religious neutrality and prevents the use of public funds for the advancement of a particular religious belief or institution. The aim of Article 27 is to maintain a secular state where the government remains impartial towards all religions and does not favor or promote any specific religion using public funds. It ensures that taxpayers' money is not utilized to endorse or support any particular religious agenda, thus preserving the religious freedom and equality of citizens. In Sri Jagannath v. the State of Orissa , AIR 1954, the court upheld the fee which was imposed. The court stated that the annual contribution was a fee and not a tax. This payment was demanded to meet the expenses of the Commissioner and his office which was set up for the administration of the religious institution. ​ In Nasima Khatun v. State of West Bengal, AIR 1981, the Bengal Wakfs Act was amended in 1973. Through this amendment, the contribution was to be asked by people for the education for economically weaker and meritorious students. The court said that this tax does not fall under Article 27 as a tax but it is a kind of Fee, which is not a prerogative of Article 27. ​ In P.M. Bhargava v. University Grants Commission, AIR 2004, the court said that the teaching of Jyotish Vigyan in a University by University Grants Commission is not religious teaching. This is a secular activity. So it does not fall under Article 27 of the Indian Constitution. References IndianKanoon ConstitutionofIndia.net Legal Service India",,,,

     [Constitution]","28. Freedom as to attendance at religious instruction or religious worship in certain educational institutions (1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. (2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the State but has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instruction shall be imparted in such institution. (3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto. Editorial Comment - Article 28 of the Indian Constitution pertains to the freedom of religion in educational institutions. It safeguards the rights of individuals, religious groups, and educational institutions with regards to religious instruction, religious worship, and attendance at religious ceremonies. No religious instruction can be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained by state funds. This ensures that public educational institutions funded by the government remain secular and do not impart religious teachings. In educational institutions that are not wholly maintained by state funds, religious instruction is allowed. However, it requires the consent of parents or guardians. Students attending these institutions have the right to choose whether or not to receive religious instruction. In educational institutions that are not wholly maintained by state funds, students belonging to a particular religion have the right to attend religious worship or religious instruction conducted by the institution. The purpose of Article 28 is to maintain the secular character of educational institutions funded by the state and to uphold the freedom of individuals to pursue their own religious beliefs or choose not to participate in religious activities. ​In Aruna Roy v. Union of India, AIR 2002 , a PIL was filed under Article 32 wherein it was contended by the petitioner that the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCFSE) is violative of the provisions of the constitution. It was contended that it was anti-secular and it should be set aside. The court ruled that there is no violation of Article 28 and there is also no prohibition to study religious philosophy for having value-based life in a society.

Protection of interests of minorities (1) Any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. Editorial Comment - Article 29 of the Indian Constitution safeguards the cultural and educational rights of minorities. It aims to protect the interests of religious, linguistic, and cultural minorities in India. Any section of citizens residing in India having a distinct language, script, or culture of its own has the right to conserve and promote its language, script, or culture. This provision ensures the preservation and development of the unique identity and heritage of minority communities. Minority communities, whether based on religion or language, have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. This enables minorities to establish educational institutions that cater to their specific cultural and linguistic needs. Article 29 also prohibits discrimination against any citizen on the grounds of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them with respect to admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the state. In the case of D.A.V. College, Jalandhar v. The State of Punjab (1971) , and the Supreme Court held that setting up of University and teaching Punjabi language is not infringing clause 1 of Article 29. In the case, St. Stephen's College v. University of Delhi (1992) , the Supreme Court dealt with the question of whether minority educational institutions can reserve seats for students belonging to their own community. The court ruled that minority institutions have the right to admit students from their own community, provided the admission process is fair and transparent. In the case, T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka , the Supreme Court addressed the issue of the right of minority educational institutions to establish and administer their institutions. The court upheld the autonomy of minority institutions in matters of admission and administration, emphasizing that they have the right to preserve their own character and identity. In the case, Animal Welfare Board v. Union of India (Jallikattu case), the Supreme Court dealt with the question whether the sport of Jallikattu was protected as a cultural right under Article 29 of the Constitution of India? The Supreme Court upheld the practice of Jallikattu, as permitted by the 2017 Tamil Nadu Amendment to the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The five-judge Bench in 2023 overruled the view taken by a two-judge Bench of the court in its 2014 ruling in Welfare Board of India v. A. Nagaraja , banning such sports including Jallikattu.

     [Constitution]","30. Right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions (1) All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. (1A) In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority, referred to in clause (1), the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause. (2) The state shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on religion or language. Editorial Comment - Article 30 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. All minorities, whether based on religion or language, have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. This includes the right to determine the type of institution, its affiliation, and the right to appoint staff. The state cannot discriminate against any educational institution on the grounds of its minority status while granting aid. Minority institutions should receive the same treatment and protection as institutions established by the majority. While minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions, they must still adhere to reasonable regulations that the state may impose in the interest of maintaining standards of education, ensuring welfare, or preventing maladministration. The purpose of Article 30 is to protect the educational rights of religious and linguistic minorities, allowing them to preserve and promote their distinct culture, language, and religious identity through educational institutions of their choice. It recognizes the importance of minority communities in the nation's diversity and provides them with the freedom to establish and manage educational institutions that cater to their specific needs and aspirations. Article 31(A) was added as part of the 42nd Constitutional Amendment which states that in case of any property acquired by the government of an educational institution then it is the duty of the government to give appropriate compensation. In this case, St. Xavier's College v. State of Gujarat (1974), the Supreme Court clarified that minority educational institutions have the right to admit students belonging to their own community and can give preference to them while making admissions, as long as the admission process is fair and transparent. In D.A.V. College, Jullundur v. State of Punjab (1971), the Supreme Court held that minority institutions have the right to appoint teachers of their choice, subject to their qualifications and suitability. It emphasized the importance of preserving the minority character of such institutions. In this case, S.P. Mittal v. Union of India 1983 , the court discussed Auroville, a township formed on the ideals of Sri Aurobindo. Tamil Nadu government took management of this township and filed a presidential ordinance which later on became The Auroville (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1980 . Seeing that the government took control of a ‘religious’ enterprise, the Constitutional validity of the Act was challenged on 4 grounds. One of the grounds was that it was violative of Article 29 and 30. It was held by the bench that the aforesaid Act does not violate Article 29 and 30. The court held that it, in no way curtailed their right or prevented any citizen from conserving its own language, script or culture and thus was not violative of Article 29. Also in this case, in order to seek protection under Article 30, one must prove that they are a linguistic or religious minority and the institution in question was established by them. Considering that Auroville was not religious and was founded on the ideology of Sri Aurobindo, they could not seek protection under these articles. In the landmark case T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002), the Supreme Court dealt with the autonomy of minority educational institutions and their right to establish and administer institutions of their choice. The Supreme Court held that minority institutions have the right to administer their affairs, including the right to appoint staff, but they must still operate within certain reasonable regulations imposed by the state.

     [Constitution]","32. Remedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part (1) The right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed. (2) The Supreme Court shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warrant and certiorari, whichever may be appropriate, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part. (3) Without prejudice to the powers conferred on the Supreme Court by clauses (1) and (2), Parliament may by law empower any other court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction ill or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under clause (2). (4) The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitution. Editorial Comment - Article 32 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that guarantees the right to constitutional remedies. It is considered one of the most crucial provisions in the Constitution as it empowers individuals to seek protection and enforcement of their fundamental rights directly from the Supreme Court of India. Article 32 grants every individual the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights. This means that if someone believes their fundamental rights have been violated, they can approach the Supreme Court directly for relief. It also ensures that not only do individuals have the right to move the Supreme Court, but the Court also has the power to issue appropriate orders, directions, or writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court can issue five types of writs under Article 32: Habeas Corpus : To ensure the release of a person who has been unlawfully detained. When Article 21 was suspended during the National Emergency, it was held in Addl. District Magistrate, Jabalpur v. Shukla (Habeas Corpus Case) that an order of preventive detention could not be challenged even if it violated the parent Act (i.e, the Act relating to preventive detention). The 44th Amendment, 1978, has provided that Article 21, relating to personal liberty cannot be suspended even during an emergency. The writ of Habeas Corpus is a check on the governmental powers to curtail the liberty of a person; its fundamental purpose is to ensure timely review of illegal detention. The scope and extent of this writ is enunciated by the Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra v. Bhaurao Punjabrao Gawande . The Court stated that the writ of habeas corpus has been described as a ""constitutional privilege or the first security of civil liberty"" as it provides a speedy remedy against illegal detention. By the virtue of this writ, the Court directs the authority which has detained a person to produce the body of the person before the Court so that it can assess the legitimacy of the arrest or detention. Mandamus : To direct a public official or authority to perform a duty they are legally bound to perform. In the case of S.P. Gupta v. Union of India , the court entailed that a writ cannot be issued against the President of India for fixing the number of judges in High Courts and filling vacancies. In E.A. Co-operative Society v. Maharastra, A.I.R. 1966 S.C. 1449 case the Court opined that the writ of mandamus can be issued when the government denies to itself a jurisdiction which it undoubtedly has under the law In Bombay Municipality v. Advance Builders, AIR 1972 SC 793 case, Bombay Municipality had prepared a town planning scheme which had been also approved by the State Government. However, no action was taken for a long time. The Court opined that the writ of mandamus can be issued where an authority vested with a power improperly refuses to exercise it and directed the municipality to implement a planning scheme. In State of West Bengal v. Nuruddin(1998) 8 SCC 143 case, the Supreme Court held the writ of mandamus is a personal action where the respondent has not done the duty they were prescribed to do by law. The performance of the duty is the right of the applicant. In The Praga Tools Corporation v. C.V. Imanual, 1969  and Sohanlal v. Union of India, (1957) the Supreme Court held that mandamus might under certain circumstances lie against a private individual if it is established that he has colluded with a public authority. Then, in the case of Manjula Manjori v. Director of Public Instruction , the publisher of a book had applied for the writ of mandamus against the Director of Public Instruction for the inclusion of his book in the list of books which were approved as text-books in schools. But the writ was not allowed as the matter was completely within the discretion of D.I.P and he was not bound to approve the book. In the case of Binny Ltd. & Anr v. V. Sadasivan & Ors (2005), the Supreme Court laid down the scope of mandamus. It stated that a writ of mandamus is not applicable against any private wrong. It can be issued only when any public authority exercises its duty unlawfully or refuses to perform its duty within the ambit of the law. In the case of Ramakrishna Mission v. Kago Kunya (2019) , The Supreme Court ruled that where a contract is of private nature or has no connection with any public authority, it does not fall within the purview of the writ of mandamus. Prohibition : To prevent a lower court or tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction. In, Brij Khandelwal v. India (1975) the Delhi High Court refused to issue a prohibition against the Central Government from engaging in a boundary dispute agreement with Sri Lanka. The judgment was founded on the basis that there is no bar against the government performing executive or administrative duties. With the idea of natural justice and the growth of the concept of fairness, there is no longer a tolerable view, even in administrative tasks. If any of the grounds on which the writ of prohibition is issued is present, the writ can now be issued to anybody, regardless of the nature of the duty fulfilled by it. Prohibition is currently considered as a broad remedy for judicial control of impacting quasi-judicial as well as administrative actions. In the case, S. Govind Menon v. Union of India (1967) a Writ of prohibition was issued by a higher court, namely the Kerala High Court, to a lower court in order to take over jurisdiction that was not initially vested, or in other words, to compel lower courts to retain their jurisdictional limitations. The writ can be issued when there is an excess of jurisdiction as well as when there is an absence of jurisdiction. In the case, Hari Vishnu v. Syed Ahmed Ishaque (1955) dealt with distinctions between writs of prohibition and certiorari. The verdict, in this case, distinguished between certiorari and prohibition writs and said that when the lower court issues a decision, the petitioner must file a certiorari petition since prohibition writs can only be submitted when judgment has not yet been given. In this case, Prudential Capital Markets Ltd v. The State of A.P. and others, (2000) it was questionable whether the prohibition writ could be issued against the district forum/state commission which had already passed judgments in the depositors’ consumer cases. The Court held that after the execution of the order, the writ of prohibition cannot be issued, the judgment can neither be prevented nor stopped. Certiorari : To quash an order passed by a lower court, tribunal, or authority. In Surya Dev Rai v. Ram Chander Rai & Ors., the Supreme Court has explained the meaning, ambit and scope of the writ of Certiorari. Also, in this it was explained that Certiorari is always available against inferior courts and not against equal or higher courts, i.e., it cannot be issued by a High Court against any High Court or benches much less to the Supreme Court and any of its benches. Then in the case of T.C. Basappa v. T. Nagappa & Anr., it was held by the constitution bench that certiorari may and is generally granted when a court has acted (i) without jurisdiction or (ii) in excess of its jurisdiction. In Hari Bishnu Kamath v. Ahmad Ishaque the Supreme Court said that “the court issuing certiorari to quash, however, could not substitute its own decision on the merits or give directions to be complied with by the court or tribunal. Its work was destructive, it simply wiped out the order passed without jurisdiction, and left the matter there.” In Naresh S. Mirajkar v. State of Maharashtra , it was said that High Court’s judicial orders are open to being corrected by certiorari and that writ is not available against the High Court. Quo Warranto : To inquire into the legality of a person's claim to a public office. In the case of G.D. Karkare v. T.L. Shevde, the High Court of Nagpur observed that “In proceedings for a writ of quo-warranto, the applicant does not seek to enforce any right of his as such nor does he complain of any non-performance of duty towards him. What is in question is the right of the non-applicant to hold the office and an order that is passed is an order ousting him from that office.” In the case of Bharati Reddy v. The State Of Karnataka (2018) , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that a writ of quo warranto cannot be issued based on assumptions, inferences, or speculations concerning the fact of accomplishment of qualifying conditions. There must be an establishment of the fact that a public officer is abusing lawful powers not vested to him within the public authority. Direct Access to Supreme Court: Unlike Article 226, which pertains to the High Courts and enables individuals to seek writs for enforcement of their fundamental rights, Article 32 provides a direct avenue to the Supreme Court for this purpose. Suspension During Emergency: During a proclamation of Emergency, the right to move the Supreme Court under Article 32 can be suspended. However, the suspension does not extend to fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 20 and 21 (protections in case of conviction and protection of life and personal liberty, respectively).

It aims to prevent political defections for reasons of office and other considerations from causing harm to democracy. Its proposed solution is to bar Members of Parliament and State Legislatures who deviate from party politics from continuing to hold their political office.

It also gives greater power to the Parliament to enact laws dealing with anti-national activities. The 88th Amendment of the Indian Constitution introduces several important changes, including the addition of a new entry in the Constitution's Seventh Schedule after entry 92B in List I-Union List, called 'Services taxation' (92C). The suggested amendment aims to increase state revenues under planned regulation and pave the way for the subsequent integration or inclusion of services under the purview of state-level VAT.

To achieve this, the 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution had to be revised. Four of these languages were added to the existing list of languages recognized as official languages. With this addition, the list now held 22 constitutionally recognized languages. It gave minority languages the identity of an officially recognized language in the Constitution. This step was noteworthy as it helped to safeguard not just the primitive and native languages but also the interests of the speakers of the language. Also Refer ]",,,,
