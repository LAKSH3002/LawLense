G - So for a particular query, whatever the top results were there, they were collected
H - Queires include right to speech, some specific cases and such topics
I - All query, case title and case URLs were collected

Phase 3 of the project
Load FAISS + article lookup
Take a user query
Convert query → embedding
Search in FAISS
Collect retrieved text
Feed them to an LLM
Generate an answer

Industry Pipeline to generate an answer based on a query
Query → SentenceTransformer → FAISS → Retrieved articles → Gemini → Answer
