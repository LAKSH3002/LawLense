Phase 2 of the project

Converting the data into embeddings
Storing them in the vector Databases
Choosing a vector databases

Detailed Explanation
- The content is first converted into a list
- Then it is splitted into legal chunks of (300-400 words).
- The chunks are converted into embeddings 

About Embeddings
Embeddings are numerical vector representing the meaning of a sentence or a paragraph
Machines can’t “understand” text like humans, but embeddings let them compare meaning mathematically.

- These embeddings are saved in pickle (saving objects to disks and loading them back)
- For Embeddings I have used SentenceTransformer library.
- The library converts legal texts into vectors so that similiar meaning are close in vector space.

- So when user enters a query, its converted to embeddings
- After then FAISS searches for Similiar embeddings

About FAISS
- FAISS is facebook AI similiarity search
- It is a library for efficiently searching through large sets of embeddings.
- When you have thousands of legal articles and a user asks a query, 
- FAISS quickly finds the most relevant embeddings instead of comparing every single one manually.
