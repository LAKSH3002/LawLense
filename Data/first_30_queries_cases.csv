Article 2,"Union Of India And Another vs Tulsiram Patel And Others on 11 July, 1985",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1134697/?formInput=Article%202,,"Clauses (1)  and (2) of Article 311 impose restrictions
upon the  exercise by  the President  or the  Governor of  a
State of  his  pleasure	 under	Article	 310(1).  These	 are
express provisions with respect to termination of service by
dismissal or  removal as  also with  respect to reduction in
rank of	 a civil  servant and  thus come within the ambit of
the  expression	  ""Except  as  expressly  provided  by	this
Constitution"" qualifying Article 310(1). Article 311 is thus
an exception  to Article 310 and was described in Parshottam
Lal Dhingra  v. Union  of India,  [1958] S.C.R.	 820,829, as
operating as a proviso to Article 310(1) though set out in a
separate Article.  Article 309	is,  however,  not  such  an
exception. It  does not lay down any express provision which
would  derogate	 from  the  amplitude  of  the	exercise  of
pleasure under	Article 310(1).	 It merely  confers upon the
appropriate Legislature	 or executive the power to make laws
and frame  rules but  this power  is  made  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution. Thus, Article 309 is subject
to Article 310(1) and any provision restricting the exercise
of the	pleasure of  the President  or Governor in an Act or
rule made  or frame  under Article  309 not being an express
provision  of  the  Constitution,  cannot  fall	 within	 the
expression   ""Except   as   expressly	provided   by	this
Constitution"" occurring	 in Article  310(1) and	 would be in
conflict  with	Article	 310(1)	 and  must  be	held  to  be
unconstitutional.  Clauses   (1)  and  (2)  of	Article	 311
expressly restrict  the manner in which a Government servant
can be	dismissed, removed  or reduced in rank and unless an
Act made  or rule  framed under Article 309 also conforms to
these restrictions, it would be void. The restriction placed
by clauses  (1) and  (2) of  Article 311  are two : (1) with
respect to  the authority  empowered to	 dismiss or remove a
government servant  provided for  in clause  (1) of  Article
311; and  (2)  with  respect  to  the  procedure  dismissal,
removal	 or  reduction	in  rank  of  a	 government  servant
provided for  in clause(2).  The second	 priviso to  Article
311(2), which  is the  central point of controversy in these
Appeals and Writ Petitions, lifts the restriction imposed by
Article 311(2)	in the	cases specified in the three clauses
of that proviso.



 Article 14 and the Second Proviso
     The next  question which  false to	 be  considered	 is,
""Does Article  14 make	any difference	to the	consequences
which flow  from the  second proviso  to Article 311(2)?"" It
was submitted  on behalf  of the  government  servants	that
Article 14  in which  the principle  of natural	 justice are
comprehended  permeates	  the	entire	 Constitution	and,
therefore, Article  14 must  be read into the second proviso
to Article  311(2) and	according if  not under that proviso
read by	 itself, under	it read with Article 14 a government
servant is  entitled to an opportunity both of showing cause
against the  charges made  against him	as also	 against the
penalty	 proposed  to  be  imposed  upon  him,	though	such
opportunity may	 not extend to the holding of a complete and
elaborate inquiry  as would  be the case where clause (2) of
Article 311  applies. According	 to learned  Counsel this is
what is	 required by  the audi	alteram partem rule which is
one of	the two	 main principles  of natural Justice. In the
alternative it	was submitted  that though  an order  may be
valid and  supportable under  the second  proviso to Article
311(2), it  could none	the less be void under Article 14 on
the ground  that the principles of natural justice have been
wholly	disregarded.  These  arguments	are  based  upon  an
imperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice
in their application in courts of law to the adjudication of
causes before  them and the function of Article 14 vis-a-vis
the other  provisions of  the Constitution  and particularly
the second proviso to Article 311(2).



 The rule of natural justice with which we are concerned
in these  Appeals  and	Writ  Petitions,  namely,  the	audi
alteram partem	rule, in  its fullest amplitude means that a
person against	whom an order to his prejudice may be passed
should be  informed of	the allegations	 and charges against
him, be	 given an  opportunity of submitting his explanation
thereto, have  the right  to know the evidence, both oral or
documentary, by	 which the  matter is proposed to be decided
against him,  and to  inspect the documents which are relied
upon for  the purpose of being used against him, to have the
witnesses who  are to  give evidence against him examined in
his presence  and have	the right to cross-examine them, and
to lead	 his own evidence, both oral and documentary, in his
defence. The  process of  a fair  hearing need not, however,
conform to  the judicial  process in a court of law, because
judicial  adjudication	 of  causes  involves  a  number  of
technical  rules   of  procedure   and	evidence  which	 are
unnecessary and	 not required  for the	purpose	 of  a	fair
hearing within	the meaning of audi alteram partem rule in a
quasi-judicial or  administrative inquiry.  If	we  look  at
clause (2)  of Article	311 in	the light  of what is stated
above, it will be apparent that	 clause is merely an express
statement  of	the  audi   alteram  partem  rule  which  is
implicitly made	 part of  the guarantee contained in Article
14 as  a result	 of  the  interpretation  placed  upon	that
Article by  recent decisions  of this  Court. Clauses (2) of
Article 311  requires that  before a  government servant  is
dismissed, removed  or reduced	in rank,  an inquiry must be
held in	 which he is informed of the charges against him and
given a	 reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of
those charges.	The nature  of the  hearing to be given to a
government servant under clauses (2) of Article 311 has been
elaborately set	 out by	 this Court  in Khem chand's case in
the passages  from the judgment extracted above. Though that
case related  to the original clause (2) of Article 311, the
same applies to the present clause (2) of Article 311 except
for the	 fact that  now a government servant has no right to
make any  representation against  the penalty proposed to be
imposed upon him but, as pointed out earlier, in the case of
Suresh Koshy  George v. The University of Kerala and others,
such an opportunity is not the requirement of the principles
of  natural   justice  and  as	held  in  Associated  Cement
Companies Ltd.	v. T.  C. Shrivastava and others neither the
ordinary law of the land nor industrial law requires such an
opportunity to be given. The

Opportunity of	showing cause  against the  proposed penalty
was only  the result  of the  interpretation placed  by	 the
Judicial Committee  of the Privy Council in Lall's Case upon
section 240(3)	of the	Government of India, 1935, which was
accepted by  this Court in Khem Chand's Case. If, therefore,
an inquiry  held against  a government	servant under clause
(2) of Article 311 is unfair or biased or has been conducted
in such	 a manner  as not  to give  him a fair or reasonable
opportunity to	defend himself,	 undoubtedly, the principles
of natural justice would be violated, but in such a case the
order of  dismissal, removal  or reduction  in rank would be
held to	 be bad	 as contravening  the express  provisions of
clause (2)  of Article	311 and	 there will  be no scope for
having	recourse   to  Article	 14  for   the	purpose	  of
invalidating it.



 (Emphasis supplied.)
     Not only,	therefore, can	the  principles	 of  natural
justice be  modified but  in exceptional cases they can even
be excluded.  There are	 well-defined exceptions to the nemo
judex in  causa sua  rule as also to the audi alteram partem
rule. The  nemo judex  in causa	 sua rule  is subject to the
doctrine of  necessity and  yields to  it as  pointed out by
this Court  in J.Mohapatra  & Co.  and another	v. State  of
Orissa and  another [1985] 1 S.C.R. 322,334-5. So far as the
audi alteram  partem rule  is concerned, both in England and
in India,  it is  well established  that where	a right to a
prior notice  and an opportunity to be heard before an order
is passed would obstruct the taking of prompt action, such a

right can be excluded. This right can also be excluded where
the nature of the action to be taken, its object and purpose
and the	 scheme of the relevant statutory provisions warrant
its exclusion;	nor can	 the audi  alteram  partem  rule  be
invoked if  importing it would have the effect of paralysing
the administrative process or where the need for promptitude
or the	urgency of  taking action so demands, as pointed out
in Maneka Gandhi's  case at page 681. If legislation and the
necessities of	a situation  can exclude  the principles  of
natural justice	 including the	audi alteram  partem rule, a
fortiorari so  can a  provision or  the Constitution,  for a
Constitutional provision has a far greater and all-pervading
sanctity than  a statutory  provision. In  the present case,
clause (2)  of Article	311 is	expressly  excluded  by	 the
opening words  of the  second proviso  and particularly	 its
key-words this clause shall not apply. As pointed out above,
clause (2) of Article 311 embodies in express words the audi
alteram partem	rule.  This  principle	of  natural  justice
having	been   expressly  excluded   by	  a   Constitutional
provision, namely,  the second	proviso	 to  clause  (2)  of
Article 311,  there is	no scope  for reintroducing  it by a
side-door to  provide once  again the same inquiry which the
Constitutional provision  has expressly	 prohibited. Where a
clause of  the second  proviso is  applied on  an extraneous
ground or  a ground  having no	relation  to  the  situation
envisaged in that clause, the action in so applying it would
be mala	 fide, and,  therefore, void.  In such	a  case	 the
invalidating factor may be referable to Article 14. This is,
however, the  only  scope  which  Article  14  can  have  in
relation to  the second	 proviso. but  to hold that once the
second proviso is properly applied and clause (2) of Article
311 excluded,  Article 14  will step in to take the place of
clause (2)  would be  to nullify  the effect  of the opening
words of the second proviso and thus frustrate the intention
of the	makers of  the Constitution.  The second  proviso is
based on  public policy	 and is	 in public  interest and for
public good and the Constitution - makers who inserted it in
Article 311(2)	were the best persons to decide whether such
an exclusionary provision should be there and the situations
in which this provision should apply.",
Article 2,Constitution of India,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/237570/,,,
Article 2,"The State Of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singhof ... on 27 May, 1952",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/41868/?formInput=Article%202,,"(ii) was a ""provision"" of article 31 (2), submitted that (i)
was  not.   According to him clause (2)assumed but  did	 not
""provide""  that acquisition should be authorised only for  a
public	purpose.  I cannot accept that view. In my  opinion,
the  clause seeks also to impose a limitation in  regard  to
public	purpose.   The clause was evidently worded  in	that
form  as it was copied (with minor variations) from  section
299  (2)  of the Government of India Act,  1935,  which	 was
undoubtedly designed to give effect to the recommendation of
the  Joint  Parliamentary Committee in para.  369  of  their
Report	that two conditions should be imposed on  expropria-
tion  of  private  property:  ""We think	 it  (the  provision
proposed)  should secure that legislation  expropriating  or
authorising  the  expropriation of the property	 of  private
individuals should be lawful only if confined to  expropria-
tion  for public purpose and if compensation  is  determined
either in the first instance or in appeal by some  independ-
ent  authority"". It is thus clear that section 299  (2)	 was
intended  to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject  to
which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private
property  should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to	con-
clude  that  article 31 (2) was also intended to impose	 the
same  two  conditions on legislation  expropriating  private
property.    In	 other	words, article 31 (2)must be  under-
stood as also providing that legislation authorising  expro-
priation of private property should be lawful only if it was
required  for  a public purpose and provision was  made	 for
payment of compensation.  Indeed if this were not so,  there
would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent	 acquisition
for  a non-public or private purpose and without payment  of
compensation--an  absurd result. It cannot be supposed	that
the  framers of	 the Constitution, while expressly  enacting
one of the two well-established restrictions on the exercise
of the right of eminent domain, left the other to be import-
ed  from the common law.  Article 81 (2) must therefore,  be
taken to provide for both the limitations in express  terms.
An attack on the

ground of contravention of these provisions implies that the
law in question authorises acquisition without reference  to
a public purpose and without payment of compensation.	This
was  precisely the objection raised both by Mr. Das and	 Dr.
Ambedkar  to  the constitutional validity  of  the  impugned
statutes, and such objection really amounts to calling those
laws  in  question on the ground that they  contravened	 the
provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel stoutly
denied	that they were relying on the provisions of  article
31(2).	 The denial, however, seems to me to be based  on  a
quibbling  distinction	without a difference  in  substance.
Their  main  attack was really grounded on  the	 absence  of
these  two  essential  prerequisites  of  valid	 legislation
authorising acquisition of private property, though Mr.	 Das
would  deduce them by implication from entry 36 of  List  II
and  entry  42	of List III, while Dr.	Ambedkar  sought  to
derive	them from the spirit of the Constitution.  But	this
is only a form of stating the objection which, in substance,
is  that  the statutes are bad because of the absence  of  a
public	purpose and the omission to provide for a just	com-
pensation.   This, in fact, was the burden of  the  argument
before us. If, then, these two grounds of attack fall within
the  purview  of article 31(4), the  words  ""notwithstanding
anything  in  this  Constitution"" are apt  to  exclude	such
grounds howsoever they are derived--whether from the entries
in the legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-
tion-for  both alike are covered by those words. Indeed,  if
the  objection based on the absence of a public purpose	 and
of a provision for just compensation were still to be  open,
clause	(4) of article 31  would be meaningless	 surplusage.
It  is	obvious that that clause was specially	designed  to
protect	 the  impugned	statutes and  other  laws  similarly
enacted	 from  attack  in a court of law  on  the  aforesaid
grounds	 and, if they were nevertheless to be considered  as
not being within the protection, it is difficult to see what
the  use of article 31 (4) would be.  Learned  counsel	were
unable to suggest any.	The fact is that article 31 (4) was

designed  to  bar the jurisdiction of  courts  to  entertain
objections to the validity of a certain class of  enactments
on  the	 two-fold ground referred to above,  and  its  whole
purpose	 would stand  defeated if the zemindars'  contention
were to prevail.



    That  the obligation to provide for compensation is	 not
included in the content of the legislative power under entry
36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List	III,
will be made further clear when we come to consider  closely
clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and article 31-A.  Article
31(4)  protects a law of the description  mentioned  therein
against the provisions of article 31(2). It follows,  there-
fore,  that what is sought to be protected by article  31(4)
is a law for the acquisition or taking possession of proper-
ty which does not, amongst other things, provide for compen-
sation or

does  not fix the amount or specify the principles on  which
and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined
and given, for otherwise there would be no necessity for any
protection.  The question at once arises as to whether there
is  any legislative entry in List 11 under which a  law	 for
acquisition or taking possession of property without compen-
sation	can  be made by a State Legislature.   To  test	 the
validity of Mr. P.R. Das's argument and to avoid the compli-
cation	arising	 out of the residuary powers  of  Parliament
under  article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken	 the
case  of a law of acquisition made by the legislatures of  a
State  which  also come within article 31  (4).	  Is  there,
then,  any entry in List II under which a State	 Legislature
can  make  a  law for acquisition  without  compensation  or
public purpose ? Obviously there is none, except entry 36 in
List  II.  If that entry by itself or read with entry 42  in
List  III has any implication as suggested, namely,  that  a
law for acquisition of property-made under entry 36 in	List
II  without a provision for compensation will be beyond	 the
legislative   competency  of the  State	 Legislatures,	then
there  is no other entry under which such a law can be	made
by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, be no point
in  making  a  provision in article  81(4)  for	 protecting,
against	 article  31(2), a law which,  on  this	 hypothesis.
cannot be made at all. Article 81(4) postulates a law  which
offends against 31 (2) and so far as the State	Legislatures
are  concerned there is no entry in List II except entry  36
under  which such an offending law may be made by the  State
Legislatures.  This  circumstance  unmistakably	 establishes
that entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with-entry 42 in
List III, has not any such implication as is imputed to	 it.
Likewise  take	article 81 (5) (b) (ii) which  protects	 the
provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make for
the  promotion of public health or the prevention of  danger
to  life  or property.	The law which is thus sought  to  be
protected must also involve acquisition of property  without
any  provision for compensation, for otherwise there can  be
no occasion or necessity for

any protection against article 31 (2).	A law of this  kind,
in so far as such law provides for acquisition of  property,
must necessarily be made by a State Legislature. if at	all,
under  entry 36 in List II.  If Mr. P.R.  Das's	 contentions
were  correct,	a  law for the promotion of  health  or	 the
prevention  of	danger	to life or  property  involving	 the
acquisition  of property without a provision  for  compensa-
tion,  which is what is sought to be protected from  article
31 (2), can never be made, for the obligation to provide for
compensation  is, according to him, implicit in	 entry36  in
List  II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List  III,	 and
there  is no other entry under which a law may be made by  a
State  Legislature with respect to acquisition of  property.
It is futile to attempt to get over this anomaly by suggest-
ing  that  clauses (4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article  31	have
been inserted in the Constitution ex abundanti cautela, for,
if Mr. P.R. Das were correct in his submission, no amount of
caution was necessary for protecting a law that, ex  hypoth-
esi, cannot be made at all. Similar arguments may as well be
founded	 on article 31-A, for that article also	 protects  a
law from article 31 (2) which is in Part III of the  Consti-
tution. It is suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid
law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of	 its
legislative  powers. If a State Legislature in making a	 law
for  the acquisition of property for a public purpose  under
entry 36 in List II must provide for compensation then a law
made  conformably  with this supposed  requirement  of	that
entry  by a State Legislature will require no protection  at
all against article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-
ed as meaningless and unnecessary.   Surely, that conclusion
is  manifestly	untenable.  In my opinion  clauses  (4)	 and
(5)(b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A clearly  negative
Mr. P.R. Das's proposition.  In my judgment, for the reasons
stated	above, the  major premise in the arguments  advanced
by  Mr.	 P.R. Das under 'the first head,  namely,  that	 the
obligation  to pay compensation is implicit in entry  36  in
Lis  II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III  is	 un-
sound.



    Assuming  that the obligation to pay compensation  which
is  expressly provided in article 31(2) is also implicit  in
entry 36 in List II by itself or read with entry 42 in	List
III, the respondents cannot. even then, be permitted to call
in  question the validity of the impugned Act on the  ground
that  it  does not provide for compensation, for  then	they
will  be  doing	 exactly what they are forbidden  to  do  by
article	 31 (4) and the newly added  articles.	Article31(4)
and the added articles debar the respondents from  question-
ing the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia,	that
it  contravenes	 or is inconsistent with or  takes  away  or
abridges  any of the rights conferred by the  provisions  of
clause (2) of article 31.  The emphasis in those articles is
rather on the ""provisions"" than on the number of the article
or the Part of the Constitution. It is obvious that the real
substance  of  the matter is that articles 31(4),  31-A	 and
31-B  expressly seek to prevent a challenge to the  validity
of the Act based on the ground, inter alia, that it does not
provide	 for  compensation. This obligation to	provide	 for
compensation is no doubt one of the provisions of article 31
(2)  but  if  as contended by Mr. P.R. Das,  the  self	same
provision be found elsewhere in the same Constitution, e.g.,
entry  36  in  List II or entry 42 in List  III,  then	that
""provision"" must also be regarded as having been covered  by
article	 31(4)	and the two added  articles,  for  otherwise
those articles will be rendered nugatory.  In my opinion, if
two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt	that
which

will  implement	 and discard that which	 will  stultify	 the
apparent  intention  of	 the  makers  of  the  Constitution.
Further, it must be borne in mind that article 31 (4)  which
applies	 ""notwithstanding  anything in	this  Constitution"",
will,  by force of the very words, protect the	Act  against
even  legislative incompetency, if any, arising out  of	 the
alleged noncompliance with the suggested implied provisions,
if any, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III.  In
my  judgment the respondents are not, by reason of  articles
31(4),	31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act in  question
on  the	 ground that it does not provide  for  compensation,
whether	 the ground is formulated as a breach of article  31
(2) or of the implied provision, if any, of the	 legislative
heads mentioned above.



    It	will  be noticed that the argument that the  Act  is
unconstitutional  is founded on the assumption that  it	 has
not laid down any principle for determining compensation  as
required by entry 42 in List III and that the provision	 for
compensation is wholly illusory. Chapter V of the Act  deals
with assessment of compensation.  Shortly put, the scheme is
to start with the gross assets which are taken to be synony-
mous  with the gross income and then to make certain  deduc-
tions  therefrom and to arrive at the net assets.  Then	 the
compensation is to be calculated at a sliding scale of rates
varying from 20 to 3 times of the net income. To the  amount
thus  determined is to be added a moiety of the	 accumulated
arrrears of rent etc. and the compensation for the mines and
minerals as determined under section 25. Ex facie, it cannot
be disputed that the Act does prescribe some principles	 for
determining  the compensation payable to the  proprietor  or
tenure-holder.	It is, however, pointed out that the  deduc-
tion of 5 to 20 per cent. of the gross assets as and by	 way
of  cost of management is quite arbitrary. It is  said	that
although  it  is well known that the percentage of  cost  of
management  in relation to the income of a small  estate  is
greater	 than that of a larger estate, yet the Act  provides
for deducting 20 percent. of the gross assets in the case of
proprietors

of  the larger estates but only 5 per cent. in	the case  of
the smaller estates.  Objection is next taken to the  deduc-
tion  of  any amount under the head of works of	 benefit  to
raiyats the and also to the scale of such deduction.   These
arguments,  to my mind, do not on close scrutiny, amount  to
saying	that  the Act does not lay down	 any  principle	 for
determining the compensation.  The real underlying  implica-
tion  of these arguments, as I understand them, is that	 the
principles  are not good enough in that they do not  produce
fair compensation.  I do not think the Court can go into the
policy of the legislation.  All that the Court is  concerned
with  is to see whether any principle has been laid down  as
mentioned  in  entry  42 in List III. It is  true  that	 the
percentage of costs of management calculated on the basis of
the  income of a big estate is less than that of  a  smaller
estate,	 but  it is quite clear that the Act has  fixed	 the
scale  of  deduction under this head and under the  head  of
works of benefit according to the capacity of the proprietor
or  tenureholder to bear it.  It is impossible to  say	that
the  provision	for deduction for works of  benefit  to	 the
raiyats	 is  not supported by any principle. A	landlord  is
expected to spend money on works of benefit to his  raiyats,
e.g.,  providing  tanks and  wells,  irrigation,  charitable
dispensary,  schools  and  so forth and be it  said  to	 the
credit	of  some of the landlords that in practice  they  do
spend  money  on this account. Therefore, there	 is  nothing
wrong,	when  calculating the net income of a  landlord,  to
deduct	something  which the' landlords should and  some  of
them often do, in practice, spend under this head.  I see no
absence of principle in this provision.	 The rate of  deduc-
tion, I have said, has been fixed according to the  capacity
of  the proprietors or tenure-holders.	It has	been  shown.
and it is not denied that in many cases a calculation of the
net  income on the basis of the principles laid down in	 the
Act operates to reduce the gross income to a very small	 net
income.	 To take only one instance, the gross annual  income
of  the	 Darbhanga  estate  is	about  Rs.  47,85,069,	 the
deduction

allowed by the Act is about Rs. 44.88,585 and the net income
computed  according to the principles laid down in  the	 Act
comes  to about Rs. 2,96,484 or say Rs. 3 lacs and the	com-
pensation  payable to  the Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga	will
be only rupees 9 lacs.	It has also been shown that at least
in  one	 case, e.g., in the case of the Raja of	 Purnea	 the
compensation calculated according to the principle laid down
in  the Act works out at a deficit figure. The fact that  in
one isolated case the calculation may work out in this	way,
does  not,  however, prove that no principle has  been	laid
down. Indeed, in all other cases the principle laid down  in
the  Act actually produces compensation, however  inadequate
it may be said to be in some cases. If a principle has	been
laid  down, then the provisions of entry 42 in List III	 are
amply satisfied and no question of legislative	incompetency
can arise. If a principle has been laid down in the Act	 but
that principle does not in fact produce any compensation  in
any  rare case or adequate compensation in some	 cases	then
the real complaint should be, not that no principle has been
laid down but, that the principle laid down does not produce
what  may  be  called just compensation.   That	 result	 may
offend against the provisions of article 31 (2) but certain-
ly not against entry 42 in List III and in view of  articles
31 (4), 31-A and 31-B the Act cannot be challenged for	non-
compliance with article 31 (2).	 On the other hand, even  if
it is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid down by
the Act, as contended, then that fact not only amounts to  a
breach	of the provisions of entry 42 in List III  but	also
constitues  a  breach of the provisions of  article  31	 (2)
which  clearly and emphatically requires the law  to  either
fix the compensation or lay down the principles on which and
the  manner in which the compensation is to be given  and  a
breach	of this ""provision"", call it a provision of  article
31(2)  or one of entry 42 in List III. cannot.	for  reasons
already	 stated,  be questioned in view of  articles  31(4),",

15. In an early judgment of this Court, M.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish

   Chandra 1954 SCR 1077, an eight-Judge Bench of this Court set out

   Article 20(3), and then went into the historical origin of this Article in

   English law. In an important passage, the Court held:
         “In view of the above background, there is no inherent
         reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as
         comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate
         to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words
         used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when
         appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberally
         construed, so as to advance the intendment thereof and


to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which
this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be
said to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right
pertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a
protection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It
is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his
giving evidence “against himself”.”
                                            (at page 1086)

Broadly stated the guarantee in Article 20(3) is against
“testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is
confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial
for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can
see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional
guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would
be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to
miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain
American decisions. The phrase used in Article 20(3) is
“to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely
by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents
or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb
witness (See Section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like.
“To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish
evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through
the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in
other modes. So far as production of documents is
concerned, no doubt Section 139 of the Evidence Act
says that a person producing a document on summons is
not a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the
right of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the
connotation of the word “witness”, which must be
understood in its natural sense i.e. as referring to a
person who furnishes evidence. Indeed, every positive
volitional act, which furnishes evidence is testimony, and
testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures
the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as
opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission
on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the
protection in respect of the evidence so procured is
confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.
The phrase used in Article 20(3) is “to be a witness” and
not to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection


         afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the
         phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of
         testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well
         extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from
         him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a
         formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence
         has been levelled which in the normal course may result
         in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in
         other situations does not call for decision in this case.
         Considered in this light, the guarantee under Article 20(3)
         would be available in the present cases to these
         petitioners against whom a first information report has
         been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to any
         compulsory     process       for production of   evidentiary
         documents which are reasonably likely to support a
         prosecution against them.



 20. We now come to the judgment of this Court in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L.

   Dani (1978) 2 SCC 424. This case referred to the inter-play between

   Article 20(3) and section 161 of the CrPC as follows:
        “21. Back to the constitutional quintessence invigorating
        the ban on self-incrimination. The area covered by Article
        20(3) and Section 161(2) is substantially the same. So
        much so, we are inclined to the view, terminological
        expansion apart, that Section 161(2) of the CrPC is a
        parliamentary gloss on the constitutional clause. The
        learned Advocate-General argued that Article 20(3), unlike
        Section 161(1), did not operate at the anterior stages
        before the case came to court and the accused's
        incriminating utterance, previously recorded, was
        attempted to be introduced. He relied on some passages
        in American decisions but, in our understanding, those
        passages do not so circumscribe and, on the other hand,
        the landmark Miranda [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436
        (1966)] ruling did extend the embargo to police
        investigation also. Moreover, Article 20(3), which is our
        provision, warrants no such truncation. Such a narrow
        meaning may emasculate a necessary protection. There
        are only two primary queries involved in this clause that
        seals the lips into permissible silence: (i) Is the person
        called upon to testify “accused of any offence”? (ii) Is he
        being compelled to be witness against himself? A
        constitutional provision receives its full semantic range
        and so it follows that a wider connotation must be
        imparted to the expressions “accused of any offence” and
        “to be witness against himself”. The learned Advocate-



        General, influenced by American decisions rightly agreed
        that in expression Section 161(2) of the Code might cover
        not merely accusations already registered in police
        stations but those which are likely to be the basis for
        exposing a person to a criminal charge. Indeed, this wider
        construction, if applicable to Article 20(3), approximates
        the constitutional clause to the explicit statement of the
        prohibition in Section 161(2). This latter provision
        meaningfully uses the expression “expose himself to a
        criminal charge”. Obviously, these words mean, not only
        cases where the person is already exposed to a criminal


charge but also instances which will imminently expose
him to criminal charges. In Article 20(3), the expression
“accused of any offence” must mean formally accused in
praesenti not in futuro — not even imminently as
decisions now stand. The expression “to be witness
against himself” means more than the court process. Any
giving of evidence, any furnishing of information, if likely to
have an incriminating impact, answers the description of
being witness against oneself. Not being limited to the
forensic stage by express words in Article 20(3), we have
to construe the expression to apply to every stage where
furnishing of information and collection of materials takes
place. That is to say, even the investigation at the police
level is embraced by Article 20(3). This is precisely what
Section 161(2) means. That sub-section relates to oral
examination by police officers and grants immunity at that
stage. Briefly, the Constitution and the Code are co-
terminus in the protective area. While the Code may be
changed, the Constitution is more enduring. Therefore, we
have to base our conclusion not merely upon Section
161(2) but on the more fundamental protection, although
equal in ambit, contained in Article 20(3).

57. We hold that Section 161 enables the police to
examine the accused during investigation. The prohibitive
sweep of Article 20(3) goes back to the stage of police
interrogation — not, as contended, commencing in court
only. In our judgment, the provisions of Article 20(3) and
Section 161(1) substantially cover the same area, so far
as police investigations are concerned. The ban on self-
accusation and the right to silence, while one investigation
or trial is under way, goes beyond that case and protects
the accused in regard to other offences pending or
imminent, which may deter him from voluntary disclosure
of criminatory matter. We are disposed to read “compelled
testimony” as evidence procured not merely by physical
threats or violence but by psychic torture, atmospheric
pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative
prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the
like — not legal penalty for violation. So, the legal perils
following upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully,


cannot be regarded as compulsion within the meaning of
Article 20(3). The prospect of prosecution may lead to
legal tension in the exercise of a constitutional right, but
then, a stance of silence is running a calculated risk. On
the other hand, if there is any mode of pressure, subtle or
crude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently
substantial, applied by the policeman for obtaining
information from an accused strongly suggestive of guilt, it
becomes “compelled testimony”, violative of Article 20(3).",

Our  Constitution  embodies generally the  Parliamentart  or
Cabinet	 system of Government of the British model both	 for
the Union and the States.  Under this system the,  President
is  the	 Constitutional or formal head of the Union  and  he
exercises  his powers and functions conferred on him  by  or
under the Constitution on the aid and advice of his  Council
of  Ministers  Article 103 is an exception to  the  aid	 and
advice of the Council of- Ministers because it	specifically
provides  that	the  President acts only  according  to	 the
opinion	 of  the  Election Commission.	 This  is  when	 any
question  arises as to whether a member of either  House  of
Parliament   has   become  subject  to	any  of	  the	dis-
qualifications mentioned in clause (1) of Article 102.
Under  the Cabinet system of Government as embodied  in	 our
Constitution  the Governor is the constitutional  or  formal
head  of  the  State and be exercises  all  his	 powers	 and
functions  conferred on him by or under the Constitution  on
the  aid  and  advice of his Council of	 Ministers  save  in
spheres	 where	the  Governor is required by  or  under	 the
Constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.
The  executive power is generally described as	the  residue
which  does  not  fall within the  legislative	or  judicial
power.	But executive power may also partake of	 legislative
or  judicial  actions.	 All powers  and  functions  of	 the
President  except his legislative powers as for	 example  in
Article 123 viz., ordinance making power and all powers	 and
functions  of the Governor except his legislative  power  as
for example in Article 213 being ordinance making powers are
executive powers of the Union vested in the President  under
Article 5 3 ( 1) in one case and are executive powers of the
State  vested  in the Governor under Article `54(1)  in	 the
other  case.  Clause (2) or Clause (3) of Article 77 is	 not
limited	 in  its operation to the executive  action  of	 the
Government  of	India  under  clause  (1)  of  Article	 77.
Similarly,  clause (2) or clause (3) of Article 166  is	 not
limited	 in  its operation to the executive  action  of	 the
Government  of	the State under clause (1) of  Article	166.
The  expression	 ""Business of the Government  of  India""  in
clause	(3) of Article 77, and the expression  ""Business  of
the  Government of the State"" in clause (3) of	Article	 166
includes all executive business.



In  all	 cases	in  which  the	President  or  the  Governor
exercises  his	functions conferred on him by or  under	 the
Constitution  with  the	 aid and advice of  his	 Council  of
Ministers  he  does  so	 by  making  rule-.  for  convenient
transaction  of the business of the Government of  India  or
the  Government of the State respectively or  by  allocation
among his Ministers of the saidbusiness, in accordance	with
Article	 77  (3)  and  166(3)  respectively.  Wherever	 the
Constitution  requires	the satisfaction of  Presidents	 the
Governor  for the exercise of any power or function  by	 the
President  or  the  Governor, as the case  may	be,  as	 for
example	 in  Articles' 123, 21-3, 311(2) proviso  (c),	317,
352(1),	 356  and  360	the  satisfaction  required  by	 the
Constitution  is  not  the  Personal  satisfaction  of	 the
President or of the Governor but is the satisfaction of	 the
President  or  of the Governor in the  Constitutional  sense
under  the  Cabinet system of Government.  The	reasons	 are
these.	It is the satisfaction of the, Council of  Ministers
on  whose  aid	and advice the	President  or  the  Governor
generally  exercises all his powers and functions.   Neither
Article 77(3) nor Article 166(3) provides for any delegation
of power.  Both Articles 77(3) and 166(3) provide

that  the  President under Article 77(3)  and  the  Governor
under	Article	 166(3)	 shall	make  rules  for  the	more
convenient  transactions of the business of  the  Government
and  the allocation of business among the ministers  of	 the
said  business.	  The rules of business and  the  allocation
among  the Ministers of the said business all indicate	that
the  decision of any Minister or officer under the rules  of
business  make under these two Articles viz., Article  77(3)
in the case of the President and Article 166(3) in the	case
of  the	 Governor  of  the State  is  the  decision  of	 the
President or the Governor respectively.



831
The Rules of Business in the Bejoy Lakshmi Cotton Mills case
(supra) indicated that the business of the Government was to
be  transacted	in  various  departments  specified  in	 the
Schedules.   Land  and	Land Revenue was  allocated  as	 the
business  of  the  Department  of  the	Minister  with	that
portfolio.    The  Minister-in-charge  had  power  to	make
standing Order regarding disposal of cases.  This Court held
that the decision of any Minister or officer under Rules  of
Business  is  a decision of the President  or  the  Governor
respectively.	The Governor means, the Governor  aided	 and
advised by the Ministers.  Neither Article 77(3) nor Article
166(3)	provides for any delegation of power.  Although	 the
executive  power  of  the State is vested  in  the  Governor
actually  it  is  carried on by	 Ministers  under  Rules  of
Business  made	under  Article 166(3).	 The  allocation  of
business of the Government is the decision, of the President
or the Governor on the aid and advice of Ministers.
This  Court in Jayantilal Amritlal Shodhan v. F. N.  Rana  &
Ors.  [1964]  5 S. C. R. 294 considered the  validity  of  a
notification issued by the President under Article 258(1) of
the   Constitution  entrusting	with  the  consent  of	 the
Government  of Bombay to the Commissioners of  Divisions  in
the State of Bombay the functions of the Central  Government
under	the  Land  Acquisition	Act  in	 relation   to	 the
acquisition of land for the purposes of the Union within the
territorial   jurisdiction   of	 the   Commissioners.	 The
notification  issued  by the President was  dated  24  July,
1959.  The Commissioner of Baroda Division, State of Gujarat
by  notification published on 1 September, 1960,  exercising
functions  under  the notification issued by  the  President
notified under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act that
certain	 land  belonging to the appellant was needed  for  a
public	 purpose.    On	 1  May,  1960	under	the   Bombay
Reorganization	Act, 1960 two States were carved out,  viz.,
Maharashtra  and Gujarat.  The appellant contended that	 the
notification  issued by the President under  Article  258(1)
was  ineffective  without the consent of the  Government  of
the, newly formed State of Gujarat.



	       *	 *		*	       *
	      The  appellant urges that the House of  People
	      having  been dissolved this clause  cannot  be
	      complied	with.  According to him	 it  follows
	      from the provisions of this Clause that it was
	      contemplated  that on the dissolution  of	 the
	      House  of	 People the Prime Minister  and	 the
	      other ministers must resign or be dismissed by
	      the President and the President must carry  on
	      the Government as best as he can with the	 aid
	      of  the  Services.  As we	 have  shown  above,
	      Article 74(1) is mandatory and, therefore, the
	      President	 cannot exercise power	without	 the
	      aid  and advice of the Council  of  Ministers.
	      We  must	then  harmonize	 the  provisions  of
	      Article 75 (3) with Article 74 (1) and Article
	      75(2). Article 75 (3) brings into  existence
	      what is usually called Responsible Government.
	      In  other words the Council of Ministers	must
	      enjoy  the confidence of the House of  People.
	      While  the House of People is-  not  dissolved
	      under  Article  82(2) (b) Article 75  (3)	 has
	      full operation.  But when it is dissolved	 the
	      Council  of Ministers cannot  naturally  enjoy
	      the confidence of the House of People.  Nobody
	      has  said that the Council of  Ministers	does
	      not  enjoy  the  confidence of  the  House  of
	      People  when it is prorogued.  In the  context
	      therefore, this clause must be read as meaning
	      that Article 75(3) only applies when the House
	      of   People  does	 not  stand   dissolved	  or
	      prorogued.   We  are not	concerned  with	 the
	      cases where dissolution of the House of People
	      takes   place  under  Article  83(2)  on	 the
	      expiration   of  the  period  of	five   years
	      prescribed   therein,   for   Parliament	 has
	      provided for that contingency in S. 14 of	 the
	      Representation of the People Act, 1951.",

Though Balaji was referred to, we must point out with respect that Balaji does not support the above statement.

40. Thomas marks the beginning of a new thinking on Article 16, though the seed of this thought is to be found in the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. The Kerala Government had, by amending Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules empowered the Government to exempt, by order, for a specified period, any member or members belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes and already in service, from passing the test which an employee had to pass as a precondition for promotion to next higher post. Exercising the said power, the Government of Kerala issued a notification granting ""temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified, special or departmental test) for a period of two years"". On the basis of the said exemption, a large number of employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who had been stagnating in their respective posts for want of passing the departmental tests, were promoted. They were now required to pass the tests within the period of exemption. Out of 51 vacancies which arose in the category of Upper Division Clerks in the year 1972, 34 were filled up by members of Scheduled Castes leaving only 17 for others. This was questioned by Thomas, a member belonging to non-reserved category. His grievance was: but for the said concession/exemption given to members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes he would have been promoted to one of those posts in view of his passing the relevant tests. He contended that Article 16(4) permits only reservations in favour of backward classes but not such an exemption. This argument was accepted by the Kerala High Court. It also upheld the further contention that inasmuch as more than 50% vacancies in the year had gone to the members of Scheduled Castes as a result of the said exemption, it is bed for violating the 50% rule in Balaji. The Stats of Kerala carried the matter in appeal to this Court which was allowed by a majority of 5:2. All the Seven Judges wrote separate opinions. The head-note to the decision in Supreme Court Reports succinctly sets out the principles enunciated in each of the judgments. We do not wish to burden this judgment by reproducing them here. We would rest content with delineating the broad features emerging from these opinions. Ray, CJ. held that Article 16(1), being a facet of Article 14, permits reasonable classification. Article 16(4) clarifies and explains that classification on the basis of backwardness. Classification of Scheduled Castes does not fall within the mischief of Article 16(2) since Scheduled Castes historically oppressed and backward, are not castes. The concession granted to them is permissible under and legitimate for the purposes of Article 16(1). The rule giving preference to an un-represented or under-represented backward community does not contravene Articles 14, 16(1) or 16(2). Any doubt on this score is removed by Article 16(4). He opined further that for determining whether a reservation is excessive or not one must have to look to the total number of posts in a given unit or department, as the case may be. Mathew, J. agreed that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1), that. Article 16(1) permits reasonable classification and that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2). He espoused the theory of 'proportional equality' evolved in certain American decisions. He does not refer to the decisions in Balaji or Devadasan in his opinion nor does he express any opinion the extent of permissible reservation. Beg, J. adopted a different reasoning. According to him, the rule and the orders issued thereunder was ""a kind of reservation"" falling under Article 16(4) itself. Krishna Iyer,J. was also of the opinion that Article 16(1) being a facet of Article 16 permits reasonable classification, that Article 16(4) is not an exception but an emphatic statement of what is inherent in Article 16(1) and further that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2) but a collection of castes, races and groups. Article 16(4) is one made of reconciling the claims of backward people and the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily entitled to, held the learned Judge. He approved the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. Fazal Ali, J. too adopted a similar approach. The learned Judge pointed out ""if we read Article 16(4) as an exception to Article 16(1) then the inescapable conclusion would be that Article 16(1) does not permit any classification at all because an express provision has been made for this in Clause (4). This, however, is contrary to the basic concept of equality contained in Article 14 which implicitly permits classification in any form provided certain conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, if no classification can be made under Article 16(1) except reservation contained in Clause (4) then the mandate contained in Article 335 would be defeated."" He held that the Rule and the orders impugned are referable to and sustainable under Article 16. The learned Judge went further and held that the rule of 50% evolved in Balaji is a mere rule of caution and was not meant to be exhaustive of all categories. He expressed the opinion that the extent of reservation depends upon the proportion of the backward classes to the total population and their representation in public services. He expressed a doubt as to the correctness of the majority view in Devadasan. Among the minority Khanna, J. preferred the view taken in Balaji and other cases to the effect that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). He opined that no preference can be provided in favour of backward classes outside Clause (4). A.C.Gupta, J. concurred with this view.



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.



PART - IV (QUESTIONS 3, 4 AND 5)
 
 

Question 3(a): Meaning of the expression ""Backward Class of citizens"" in Article 16(4).

60. What does the expression ""Backward Class of Citizens"" in Article 16(4) signify and how should they be identified? This has been the single most difficult question tormenting this nation. The expression is not defined in the Constitution. What does it mean then? The arguments before us mainly revolved round this question. Several shades of opinion have been presented to us ranging from one extreme to the other. Indeed, it may be difficult to set out in full the reasoning presented before us orally and in several written propositions submitted by various counsel. We can mention only the substance of and the broad features emerging from those submissions. At one end of the spectrum stands Sri N.A. Palkhiwala (supported by several other counsel) whose submissions may briefly be summarised in the following words: a secular, unified and caste-less society is a basic feature of the Constitution. Caste is a prohibited ground of distinction under the Constitution. It ought be erased altogether
 from the Indian Society. It can never be the basis for determining backward classes referred to in Article 16(4). The Report of the Mandal Commission, which is the basis of the impugned Memorandums, has treated the expression ""backward classes"" as synonymous with backward castes and has proceed to identify backward classes solely and exclusively on the basis of caste, ignoring all other considerations including poverty. It has indeed invented castes for Non-Hindus where none exists. The Report has divided the nation into two sections, backward and forward, placing 52% of the population in the former section. Acceptance of Report would spell disaster to the unity and integrity of the nation. If half of the posts are reserved for backward classes, it would seriously jeopardise the efficiency of the administration, educational system, and all other services
 resulting in backwardness of the entire nation. Merit will disappear
 by deifying backwardness. Article 16(4) is broader than Article 15(4). The expression ""backward class of citizens"" in Article 16(4) is not limited to ""socially and educationally backward classes"" in Article 15(4). The impugned Memorandums, based on the said report must necessarily fall to the ground along with the Report. In fact the main thrust of Sri Palkhiwala's argument has been against the Mandal Commission Report.



64. Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned Counsel appearing for Srinarayana Dharama Paripalana Yogam (an association of Ezhavas in Kerala) submitted that Article 16(4) and 15(4) occupy different fields and serve different purposes. Whereas Article 15(4) contemplates positive action programmes, Article 16(4) enables the State to undertake schemes of positive discrimination. For this reason, the class of intended beneficiaries under both the clauses is different. The social and educational backwardness which is the basis of identifying backwardness
 under Article 15(4) is only partly true in the case of 'backward class of citizens' in Article 16(4). The expression ""any backward class of citizens"" occurring in Article 16(4) must be understood in the light of the purpose of the said clause namely, empowerment of those groups and classes which have been kept out of the administration - classes which have suffered historic disabilities
 arising from discrimination or disadvantage or both and who must now be provided entry into the administrative apparatus. In the light of the fact that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also intended to be beneficiaries of Article 16(4) there is no reason why caste cannot be an exclusive criteria for determining beneficiaries under Article 16(4). Counsel emphasised the fact that Article 16(4) speaks of group protection and not individual protection.",
Article 4,Constitution of India,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/237570/,,,
Article 4,"The State Of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singhof ... on 27 May, 1952",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/41868/?formInput=Article%204,,"It	will be seen that the scope of article 31 (4) is  at
once  narrower	and  wider than that of	 article  31-A;	 the
former	has application only to statutes which were  pending
in the legislature at the commencement of the  Constitution,
whereas	 the  latter  is subject  to  no  such	restriction.
Again,	article	 31 (4)	 excludes attack only on the  ground
of contravention of article 31 (2), while article 3 I-A bars
objections  based  on contravention of other  provisions  of
Part  III as well, such as articles 14 and 19.	This  indeed
was the reason for the enactment of articles 31-A and  31-B,
as the words of exclusion in article 31 (4) were found inapt
to  cover objections based on contravention of	article	 14.
On  the	 other hand, the law referred to in article  31	 (4)
covers	acquisition of any kind of property,  while  article
31-A relates only to the acquisition of a particular kind of
property, viz., estates and rights therein, and what is more
important  for our present purpose, the non obstante  clause
in  article  31 (4) overrides all other	 provisions  in	 the
Constitution  including	 the List of the  Seventh  Schedule,
whereas	 a law which falls within the purview of  article  a
1-A  could  only prevail over ""the foregoing  provisions  of
this Part"". Now, the three impugned statutes fall within the
ambit  of  both article 31 (4) and articles 31-A  and  31-B.
Putting	 aside	the latter articles for the  moment,  it  is
plain  that, under article 31 (4), the three impugned  stat-
utes  are protected from attack in any court on	 the  ground
that they contravene the provisions of article 31(2).  These
provisions, so far as they are material here, are (i) that a
law with respect to acquisition of property should authorize
acquisition  only  for	a public purpose and (ii) that	such
law  should  provide for compensation, etc. Mr.	 Das,  while
admitting that




(ii) was a ""provision"" of article 31 (2), submitted that (i)
was  not.   According to him clause (2)assumed but  did	 not
""provide""  that acquisition should be authorised only for  a
public	purpose.  I cannot accept that view. In my  opinion,
the  clause seeks also to impose a limitation in  regard  to
public	purpose.   The clause was evidently worded  in	that
form  as it was copied (with minor variations) from  section
299  (2)  of the Government of India Act,  1935,  which	 was
undoubtedly designed to give effect to the recommendation of
the  Joint  Parliamentary Committee in para.  369  of  their
Report	that two conditions should be imposed on  expropria-
tion  of  private  property:  ""We think	 it  (the  provision
proposed)  should secure that legislation  expropriating  or
authorising  the  expropriation of the property	 of  private
individuals should be lawful only if confined to  expropria-
tion  for public purpose and if compensation  is  determined
either in the first instance or in appeal by some  independ-
ent  authority"". It is thus clear that section 299  (2)	 was
intended  to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject  to
which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private
property  should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to	con-
clude  that  article 31 (2) was also intended to impose	 the
same  two  conditions on legislation  expropriating  private
property.    In	 other	words, article 31 (2)must be  under-
stood as also providing that legislation authorising  expro-
priation of private property should be lawful only if it was
required  for  a public purpose and provision was  made	 for
payment of compensation.  Indeed if this were not so,  there
would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent	 acquisition
for  a non-public or private purpose and without payment  of
compensation--an  absurd result. It cannot be supposed	that
the  framers of	 the Constitution, while expressly  enacting
one of the two well-established restrictions on the exercise
of the right of eminent domain, left the other to be import-
ed  from the common law.  Article 81 (2) must therefore,  be
taken to provide for both the limitations in express  terms.
An attack on the

ground of contravention of these provisions implies that the
law in question authorises acquisition without reference  to
a public purpose and without payment of compensation.	This
was  precisely the objection raised both by Mr. Das and	 Dr.
Ambedkar  to  the constitutional validity  of  the  impugned
statutes, and such objection really amounts to calling those
laws  in  question on the ground that they  contravened	 the
provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel stoutly
denied	that they were relying on the provisions of  article
31(2).	 The denial, however, seems to me to be based  on  a
quibbling  distinction	without a difference  in  substance.
Their  main  attack was really grounded on  the	 absence  of
these  two  essential  prerequisites  of  valid	 legislation
authorising acquisition of private property, though Mr.	 Das
would  deduce them by implication from entry 36 of  List  II
and  entry  42	of List III, while Dr.	Ambedkar  sought  to
derive	them from the spirit of the Constitution.  But	this
is only a form of stating the objection which, in substance,
is  that  the statutes are bad because of the absence  of  a
public	purpose and the omission to provide for a just	com-
pensation.   This, in fact, was the burden of  the  argument
before us. If, then, these two grounds of attack fall within
the  purview  of article 31(4), the  words  ""notwithstanding
anything  in  this  Constitution"" are apt  to  exclude	such
grounds howsoever they are derived--whether from the entries
in the legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-
tion-for  both alike are covered by those words. Indeed,  if
the  objection based on the absence of a public purpose	 and
of a provision for just compensation were still to be  open,
clause	(4) of article 31  would be meaningless	 surplusage.
It  is	obvious that that clause was specially	designed  to
protect	 the  impugned	statutes and  other  laws  similarly
enacted	 from  attack  in a court of law  on  the  aforesaid
grounds	 and, if they were nevertheless to be considered  as
not being within the protection, it is difficult to see what
the  use of article 31 (4) would be.  Learned  counsel	were
unable to suggest any.	The fact is that article 31 (4) was

designed  to  bar the jurisdiction of  courts  to  entertain
objections to the validity of a certain class of  enactments
on  the	 two-fold ground referred to above,  and  its  whole
purpose	 would stand  defeated if the zemindars'  contention
were to prevail.



    That  the obligation to provide for compensation is	 not
included in the content of the legislative power under entry
36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List	III,
will be made further clear when we come to consider  closely
clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and article 31-A.  Article
31(4)  protects a law of the description  mentioned  therein
against the provisions of article 31(2). It follows,  there-
fore,  that what is sought to be protected by article  31(4)
is a law for the acquisition or taking possession of proper-
ty which does not, amongst other things, provide for compen-
sation or

does  not fix the amount or specify the principles on  which
and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined
and given, for otherwise there would be no necessity for any
protection.  The question at once arises as to whether there
is  any legislative entry in List 11 under which a  law	 for
acquisition or taking possession of property without compen-
sation	can  be made by a State Legislature.   To  test	 the
validity of Mr. P.R. Das's argument and to avoid the compli-
cation	arising	 out of the residuary powers  of  Parliament
under  article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken	 the
case  of a law of acquisition made by the legislatures of  a
State  which  also come within article 31  (4).	  Is  there,
then,  any entry in List II under which a State	 Legislature
can  make  a  law for acquisition  without  compensation  or
public purpose ? Obviously there is none, except entry 36 in
List  II.  If that entry by itself or read with entry 42  in
List  III has any implication as suggested, namely,  that  a
law for acquisition of property-made under entry 36 in	List
II  without a provision for compensation will be beyond	 the
legislative   competency  of the  State	 Legislatures,	then
there  is no other entry under which such a law can be	made
by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, be no point
in  making  a  provision in article  81(4)  for	 protecting,
against	 article  31(2), a law which,  on  this	 hypothesis.
cannot be made at all. Article 81(4) postulates a law  which
offends against 31 (2) and so far as the State	Legislatures
are  concerned there is no entry in List II except entry  36
under  which such an offending law may be made by the  State
Legislatures.  This  circumstance  unmistakably	 establishes
that entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with-entry 42 in
List III, has not any such implication as is imputed to	 it.
Likewise  take	article 81 (5) (b) (ii) which  protects	 the
provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make for
the  promotion of public health or the prevention of  danger
to  life  or property.	The law which is thus sought  to  be
protected must also involve acquisition of property  without
any  provision for compensation, for otherwise there can  be
no occasion or necessity for

any protection against article 31 (2).	A law of this  kind,
in so far as such law provides for acquisition of  property,
must necessarily be made by a State Legislature. if at	all,
under  entry 36 in List II.  If Mr. P.R.  Das's	 contentions
were  correct,	a  law for the promotion of  health  or	 the
prevention  of	danger	to life or  property  involving	 the
acquisition  of property without a provision  for  compensa-
tion,  which is what is sought to be protected from  article
31 (2), can never be made, for the obligation to provide for
compensation  is, according to him, implicit in	 entry36  in
List  II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List  III,	 and
there  is no other entry under which a law may be made by  a
State  Legislature with respect to acquisition of  property.
It is futile to attempt to get over this anomaly by suggest-
ing  that  clauses (4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article  31	have
been inserted in the Constitution ex abundanti cautela, for,
if Mr. P.R. Das were correct in his submission, no amount of
caution was necessary for protecting a law that, ex  hypoth-
esi, cannot be made at all. Similar arguments may as well be
founded	 on article 31-A, for that article also	 protects  a
law from article 31 (2) which is in Part III of the  Consti-
tution. It is suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid
law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of	 its
legislative  powers. If a State Legislature in making a	 law
for  the acquisition of property for a public purpose  under
entry 36 in List II must provide for compensation then a law
made  conformably  with this supposed  requirement  of	that
entry  by a State Legislature will require no protection  at
all against article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-
ed as meaningless and unnecessary.   Surely, that conclusion
is  manifestly	untenable.  In my opinion  clauses  (4)	 and
(5)(b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A clearly  negative
Mr. P.R. Das's proposition.  In my judgment, for the reasons
stated	above, the  major premise in the arguments  advanced
by  Mr.	 P.R. Das under 'the first head,  namely,  that	 the
obligation  to pay compensation is implicit in entry  36  in
Lis  II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III  is	 un-
sound.



    Assuming  that the obligation to pay compensation  which
is  expressly provided in article 31(2) is also implicit  in
entry 36 in List II by itself or read with entry 42 in	List
III, the respondents cannot. even then, be permitted to call
in  question the validity of the impugned Act on the  ground
that  it  does not provide for compensation, for  then	they
will  be  doing	 exactly what they are forbidden  to  do  by
article	 31 (4) and the newly added  articles.	Article31(4)
and the added articles debar the respondents from  question-
ing the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia,	that
it  contravenes	 or is inconsistent with or  takes  away  or
abridges  any of the rights conferred by the  provisions  of
clause (2) of article 31.  The emphasis in those articles is
rather on the ""provisions"" than on the number of the article
or the Part of the Constitution. It is obvious that the real
substance  of  the matter is that articles 31(4),  31-A	 and
31-B  expressly seek to prevent a challenge to the  validity
of the Act based on the ground, inter alia, that it does not
provide	 for  compensation. This obligation to	provide	 for
compensation is no doubt one of the provisions of article 31
(2)  but  if  as contended by Mr. P.R. Das,  the  self	same
provision be found elsewhere in the same Constitution, e.g.,
entry  36  in  List II or entry 42 in List  III,  then	that
""provision"" must also be regarded as having been covered  by
article	 31(4)	and the two added  articles,  for  otherwise
those articles will be rendered nugatory.  In my opinion, if
two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt	that
which

will  implement	 and discard that which	 will  stultify	 the
apparent  intention  of	 the  makers  of  the  Constitution.
Further, it must be borne in mind that article 31 (4)  which
applies	 ""notwithstanding  anything in	this  Constitution"",
will,  by force of the very words, protect the	Act  against
even  legislative incompetency, if any, arising out  of	 the
alleged noncompliance with the suggested implied provisions,
if any, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III.  In
my  judgment the respondents are not, by reason of  articles
31(4),	31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act in  question
on  the	 ground that it does not provide  for  compensation,
whether	 the ground is formulated as a breach of article  31
(2) or of the implied provision, if any, of the	 legislative
heads mentioned above.",
Article 4,"Article 368 in Constitution of India
          
  

  
     [Constitution]",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/594125/,,,
Article 4,"M.Nagaraj & Others vs Union Of India & Others on 19 October, 2006",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/102852/?formInput=Article%204,,"consists of equality of opportunity  [Article 16(1)], anti-
discrimination [Article 16(2)], special classification 
[Article 16(3)], affirmative action [Article 16(4)] which 
does not obliterate equality but which stands for 
classification within equality], and lastly, efficiency 
[Article 335].  As regards the words 'nothing in this 
article' in Article 16(4), it is urged that these words 
cannot wipe out Article 16(1) and, therefore, they have a 
limited meaning.  It is urged that the said words also 
occur in Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B).   It is urged that 
equality in the Constitution conceives the individual right 
to be treated fairly without discrimination in the matter 
of equality of opportunity.  It also conceives of affirmative 
action in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4). It enables 
classification as a basis for enabling preferences and 
benefits for specific beneficiary groups and that neither 
classification nor affirmative action can obliterate the 
individual right to equal opportunity.  Therefore, a 
balance has to be evolved to promote equal opportunities 
while protecting individual rights.  It is urged that as an 
individual right in Article 16(1), enforceability is provided 
for whereas ""group expectation"" in Article 16(4) is not a 
fundamental right but it is an enabling power which is 
not coupled with duty.  It is submitted that if the 
structural balance of equality in the light of the efficiency 
is disturbed and if the individual right is encroached 
upon by excessive support for group expectations, it 
would amount to reverse discrimination.



	At the outset, this Court stated that it was not 
concerned with the validity of constitutional amendments 
and, therefore, it proceeded on the assumption that 
Article 16(4A) is valid and is not unconstitutional.  
Basically, the question decided was whether the 'catch-
up' principle was tenable in the context of Article 16(4).  
It was held that the primary purpose of Article 16(4) and 
Article 16(4A) is to give due representation to certain 
classes in certain posts keeping in mind Articles 14, 16(1) 
and 335; that, Articles 14 and 16(1) have prescribed 
permissive limits to affirmative action by way of 
reservation under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the 
Constitution; that, Article 335 is incorporated so that 
efficiency of administration is not jeopardized and that 
Articles 14 and 16(1) are closely connected as they deal 
with individual rights of the persons.  They give a positive 
command to the State that there shall be equality of 
opportunity of all citizens in public employment.  It was 
further held that Article 16(1) flows from Article 14. It 
was held that the word 'employment' in Article 16(1) is 
wide enough to include promotions to posts at the stage 
of initial level of recruitment.  It was observed that Article 
16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for 
promotion fundamental right to be considered for 
promotion.  It was held that equal opportunity means the 
right to be considered for promotion.  The right to be 
considered for promotion was not a statutory right.  It 
was held that Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) did not confer any 
fundamental right to reservation.  That they are only 
enabling provisions.  Accordingly, in Ajit Singh (II)3, the 
judgment of this Court in Jagdish Lal20 case was 
overruled.  However, in the context of balancing of 
fundamental rights under Article 16(1) and the rights of 
reserved candidate under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A), this 
Court opined that Article 16(1) deals with a fundamental 
right whereas Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) are only enabling 
provisions and, therefore, the interests of the reserved 
classes must be balanced against the interests of other 
segments of society.  As a remedial measure, the Court 
held that in matters relating to affirmative action by the 
State, the rights under Articles 14 and 16 are required to 
be protected and a reasonable balance should be struck 
so that the affirmative action by the State does not lead 
to reverse discrimination.



Clauses (1) and (4) of Article 16 are restatements of the 
principle of equality under Article 14.  Clause (4) of 
Article 16 refers to affirmative action by way of 
reservation.  Clause (4) of Article 16, however, states that 
the appropriate Government is free to provide for 
reservation in cases where it is satisfied on the basis of 
quantifiable data that backward class is inadequately 
represented in the services.  Therefore, in every case 
where the State decides to provide for reservation there 
must exist two circumstances, namely, 'backwardness' 
and 'inadequacy of representation'.  As stated above  
equity, justice and efficiency are variable factors.  These 
factors are context-specific.  There is no fixed yardstick to 
identify and measure these three factors, it will depend 
on the facts and circumstances of each case.  These are 
the limitations on the mode of the exercise of power by 
the State.  None of these limitations have been removed 
by the impugned amendments. If the concerned State 
fails to identify and measure backwardness, inadequacy 
and overall administrative efficiency then in that event 
the provision for reservation would be invalid. These 
amendments do not alter the structure of Articles 14, 15 
and 16 (equity code).  The parameters mentioned in 
Article 16(4) are retained.  Clause (4A) is derived from 
clause (4) of Article 16.  Clause (4A) is confined to SCs 
and STs alone.  Therefore, the present case does not 
change the identity of the Constitution.  The word 
""amendment"" connotes change.  The question is  
whether the impugned amendments discard the original 
constitution.   It was vehemently urged on behalf of the 
petitioners that the Statement of Objects and Reasons 
indicate that the impugned amendments have been 
promulgated by the Parliament to overrule the decision of 
this court.  We do not find any merit in this argument.  
Under Article 141 of the Constitution the pronouncement 
of this court is the law of the land.  The judgments of this 
court in Virpal Singh1, Ajit Singh (I)2 , Ajit Singh (II)3 
and Indra Sawhney5, were judgments delivered by this 
court which enunciated the law of the land.  It is that law 
which is sought to be changed by the impugned 
constitutional amendments.  The impugned 
constitutional amendments are enabling in nature.  They 
leave it to the States to provide for reservation.  It is well-
settled that the Parliament while enacting a law does not 
provide content to the ""right"".  The content is provided by 
the judgments of the Supreme Court.  If the appropriate 
Government enacts a law providing for reservation 
without keeping in mind the parameters in Article 16(4) 
and Article 335 then this court will certainly set aside 
and strike down such legislation.  Applying the ""width 
test"", we do not find obliteration of any of the 
constitutional limitations.  Applying the test of ""identity"", 
we do not find any alteration in the existing structure of 
the equality code.  As stated above, none of the axioms 
like secularism, federalism etc. which are overarching 
principles have been violated by the impugned 
constitutional amendments.  Equality has two facets  
""formal equality"" and ""proportional equality"".  
Proportional equality is equality ""in fact"" whereas formal 
equality is equality ""in law"".  Formal equality exists in the 
Rule of Law.  In the case of proportional equality the 
State is expected to take affirmative steps in favour of 
disadvantaged sections of the society within the 
framework of liberal democracy.  Egalitarian equality is 
proportional equality.   



It is important to bear in mind the nature of 
constitutional amendments.  They are curative by nature.  
Article 16(4) provides for reservation for backward classes 
in cases of inadequate representation in public 
employment.  Article 16(4) is enacted as a remedy for the 
past historical discriminations against a social class.  
The object in enacting the enabling provisions like 
Articles 16(4), 16(4A) and 16(4B) is that the State is 
empowered to identify and recognize the compelling 
interests.  If the State has quantifiable data to show 
backwardness and inadequacy then the State can make 
reservations in promotions keeping in mind maintenance 
of efficiency which is held to be a constitutional limitation 
on the discretion of the State in making reservation as 
indicated by Article 335.  As stated above, the concepts of 
efficiency, backwardness, inadequacy of representation 
are required to be identified and measured.  That exercise 
depends on availability of data.  That exercise depends on 
numerous factors.  It is for this reason that enabling 
provisions are required to be made because each 
competing claim seeks to achieve certain goals.  How best 
one should optimize these conflicting claims can only be 
done by the administration in the context of local 
prevailing conditions in public employment.  This is 
amply demonstrated by the various decisions of this 
Court discussed hereinabove.  Therefore, there is a basic 
difference between 'equality in law' and 'equality in fact' 
(See:  'Affirmative Action' by William Darity).  If Articles 
16(4A) and 16(4B) flow from Article 16(4) and if Article 
16(4) is an enabling provision then Articles 16(4A) and 
16(4B) are also enabling provisions.  As long as the 
boundaries mentioned in Article 16(4), namely, 
backwardness, inadequacy and efficiency of 
administration are retained in Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B) 
as controlling factors, we cannot attribute constitutional 
invalidity to these enabling provisions.  However, when 
the State fails to identify and implement the controlling 
factors then excessiveness comes in, which is to be 
decided on the facts of each case.  In a given case, where 
excessiveness results in reverse discrimination, this 
Court has to examine individual cases and decide the 
matter in accordance with law.  This is the theory of 
'guided power'.  We may once again repeat that equality 
is not violated by mere conferment of power but it is 
breached by arbitrary exercise of the power conferred.",

	  Constitution	is  not	 static:  We  shall  at	 the
	  outset  deal	with  the contention raised  by	 Sri
	  D.D.Thakur,  learned senior counsel appearing	 for
	  the reserved candidates that Article 16(4) must be
	  interpreted	keeping	 in   mind  the	  conditions
	  prevailing  fifty years ago when the	Constitution
	  was	drafted	  and  when    Article	 16(4)	 was
	  incorporated in the Constitution.  Learned counsel
	  submitted that the founding fathers were conscious
	  that	a  special  provision  for  reservation	 was
	  necessary  to	 see  that the backward	 classes  of
	  citizens   were  adequately	represented  in	 the
	  services.   Hence  an interpretation	which  would
	  advance  the	said  objective	  must	be  applied.
	  Reliance  was	 also  placed on  the  Statement  of
	  Objects  and	Reasons	 in   connection  with	 the
	  incorporation of Article 16(4A).  In fact, all the
	  learned   counsel  appearing	 for  the   reserved
	  candidates  contended that the said officers could
	  not be treated as equals to the general candidates
	  and  that  their  backwardness   and	past  social
	  oppression must be borne in mind.  Nobody can deny
	  that	the  above approach is the proper one  while
	  dealing  with	 the reserved classes.	The  primary
	  purpose of Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A) is due
	  representation  of  certain	classes	 in  certain
	  posts.   However,  we	 must bear in mind  and	 not
	  ignore  that	there are other provisions,  namely,
	  Articles   14,  16(1)	 and   Article	335  of	 the
	  Constitution	which are also very important.	 The
	  Constitution	has  laid  down in Articles  14	 and
	  16(1) the permissible limits of affirmative action
	  by  way  of reservation under Articles  16(4)	 and
	  16(4A).  While permitting reservations at the same
	  time,	 it  has also placed certain limitations  by
	  way  of Articles 14 and 16(1) so that there is  no
	  reverse  discrimination.  It has also incorporated
	  Article   335	  so   that    the   efficiency	  of
	  administration   is	not    jeopardized.    While
	  interpreting provisions of the Constitution and in
	  particular  fundamental rights of citizens, it  is
	  well to bear in mind certain fundamental concepts.
	  In  McCulloch	 Vs.  Maryland ( 1819) 4  Wheel	 (17
	  U.S.316), Chief Justice Marshall cautioned that we
	  must keep in mind that it is the Constitution that
	  we  are expounding.  He said that the Constitution
	  was  intended	 to endure for ages to come and	 had
	  consequently	to be adapted to the various  crises
	  of  human  affairs from time to time.	 Brandeis  J
	  wrote	 :   ""Our  Constitution is  not	 a  straight
	  jacket.   It is a living organism.  As such it  is
	  capable  of growth, of expansion and of adaptation
	  to   new  conditions.	   Growth  implies  changes,
	  political,  economic and social.  Growth which  is
	  significant	 manifests    itself	rather	  in
	  intellectual	and  moral conceptions	of  material
	  things""  (Brandeis  Papers, Harvard  Law  School).
	  Similarly, in a beautiful metaphor Mr.  J.M.	Beck
	  said as follows:



while  the  rights covered by Articles 16(4) and 16(4A)	 are
""fundamental  rights"".	Such a view has also been  expressed
in Jagdish Lal and some other latter cases where these cases
have been followed.  Counsel submitted that this was not the
correct	 constitutional	 position.  In this  connection	 our
attention  has been invited to para 43 of Ashok Kumar Gupta.
It reads as follows:-

	  ""It would thus be clear that right to promotion is
a  statutory  right.   It is not a fundamental	right.	 The
right  to promotion to a post or class of posts depends upon
the  operation of the conditions of service.  Article  16(4)
read  with  Articles  16(1)  and 14 guarantees	a  right  to
promotion  to Dalits and Tribes as a fundamental right where
they  do not have adequate representation consistently	with
the  efficiency of administration...  before expiry  thereof
(i.e.  5 years rule), Article 16(4) has come into force from
17.6.1995.  Therefore, the right to promotion continues as a
constitutionally  guaranteed  fundamental right."" A  similar
view was expressed in Jagdishlal and followed in some latter
cases.	 In  the  above	 passage,  it  was  laid  down	that
promotion  was a statutory right and that Articles 16(4) and
16(4A)	conferred  fundamental rights.	In our opinion,	 the
above  view expressed in Ashok Kumar Gupta, and followed  in
Jagdish	 Lal and other cases, if it is intended to lay	down
that   the   right  guaranteed	to   employees	 for   being
""considered""  for  promotion according to relevant rules  of
recruitment by promotion(i.e.  whether on basis of seniority
or  merit)  is only a statutory right and not a	 fundamental
right,	we  cannot accept the proposition.  We have  already
stated	earlier	 that the right to equal opportunity in	 the
matter	of  promotion  in  the	sense	of  a  right  to  be
""considered""  for  promotion is indeed a  fundamental  right
guaranteed  under  Article  16(1) and this  has	 never	been
doubted	 in  any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta,  right
from  1950.   Articles	16(4) and 16(4A) do not	 confer	 any
fundamental  right  to	reservation:  We next  come  to	 the
question whether Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A) guaranteed
any  fundamental  right to reservation.	 It should be  noted
that  both these Articles open with a non-obstante clause  -
""Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making
any  provision	for  reservation....."".	 There is  a  marked
difference  in the language employed in Article 16(1) on the
one  hand and Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A).	 There is no
directive  or command in Article 16(4) or Article 16(4A)  as
in  Article 16(1).  On the face of it, the above language in
each  of  Articles 16(4) and 16(4A), is in the nature of  an
enabling  provision  and  it has been so held  in  judgments
rendered  by  Constitution Benches and in other cases  right
from  1963.   We may in this connection point out  that	 the
attention  of  the  learned Judges who decided	Ashok  Kumar
Gupta  and  Jagdish Lal was not obviously drawn to a  direct
case  decided  by a Constitution Bench in C.A.Rajendran	 vs.
Union  of  India 1968 (1) SCC 721 which arose under  Article
16(4).	 It  was clearly laid down by the five	Judge  Bench
that  Article  16(4)  was only an enabling  provision,	that
Article	 16(4)	was not a fundamental right and that it	 did
not  impose  any constitutional duty.  It only	conferred  a
discretion  on	the  State.  The passage in the	 above	case
reads as follows:



	  ""In  this connection, it is necessary to emphasise
that  Article  15(4)  like  Article  16(4)  is	an  enabling
provision,  it	does  not impose an obligation,	 but  merely
leaves it to the discretion of the appropriate government to
take suitable action, if necessary.""

 Unfortunately, all these rulings of larger Benches
were  not  brought to the notice of the Bench which  decided
Ashok  Kumar Gupta and Jagdish Lal and to the Benches  which
followed  these	 two  cases.  In view  of  the	overwhelming
authority  right from 1963, we hold that both Articles 16(4)
and  16(4A) do not confer any fundamental rights nor do they
impose	any constitutional duties but are only in the nature
of  enabling provision vesting a discretion in the State  to
consider   providing   reservation  if	 the   circumstances
mentioned  in  those Articles so warranted.  We	 accordingly
hold  that on this aspect Ashok Kumar Gupta, Jagdishlal	 and
the cases which followed these cases do not lay down the law
correctly.   Power  is	coupled with duty:   Learned  senior
counsel for the reserved candidates, Sri K.Parasaran however
contended  that	 Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A)  confer  a
power  coupled with a duty and that it would be	 permissible
to  enforce  such  a  duty by issuing a	 writ  of  mandamus.
Reliance  for  that purpose was placed upon Comptroller	 and
Auditor	 General of India, Gian Prakash vs.  K.S.Jagannathan
[1986  (2)  SCC	 679] and also on Julius  vs.	Lord  Bishop
(1880)	5  AC 214 which case was followed by this  Court  in
Commissioner  of  Police  vs.  Gordhandas Bhanji  [1952	 SCR
135].  We are unable to agree with the above contention. As
pointed out earlier, the Constitution Bench of this Court in
C.A.   Rajendran Vs.  Union of India (1968(1) SCR 721)	held
that Article 16(4) conferred a discretion and did not create
any  constitutional  duty or obligation.  In fact,  in	that
case,  a  mandamus  was sought to direct the  Government  of
India  to  provide  for reservation under Article  16(4)  in
certain	 Class	I  and Class II	 services.   The  Government
stated	that  in  the  context of Article  335	and  in	 the
interests  of efficiency of administration at those  levels,
it was of the view that there should be no reservation.	 The
said opinion of the Government was accepted by this Court as
reasonable and mandamus was refused.  Even in M.R.  Balaji's
case,  the  Constitution Bench declared that  Article  16(4)
conferred   only  a  discretion. It	is  true   that	  in
Jagannathan's case, the three Judge Bench issued a mandamus,
after referring to Article 142, that the Government must add
25  marks  to  SC/ST  candidates who had  taken	 the  S.A.S.
Examination  for  promotion  as Sections Officers  and	also
that,  in  future, a reduced minimum marks must be  provided
and  announced	before	the  examination.   The	 Court	also
observed  that the Department had not passed orders as per a
general	 O.M.	of the Government dated 21.9.1977. But	 the
attention  of the Court was not drawn to the judgment of the
Constitution Bench in C.A.  Rajendran's case and other cases
to which we have referred earlier.  Further, if the State is
of  the	 opinion  that	in the interests  of  efficiency  of
administration,	 reservation  or relaxation in marks is	 not
appropriate,  then it will not be permissible for the  Court
to   issue  a  mandamus	 to   provide  for  reservation	  or
relaxation. We also note that in Superintending  Engineer,
Public	Health	Vs.   Kuldeep  Singh  (	 1997(9)  SCC  199),
Jagannathan's  case  was followed and reference was made  to
Article	 16(4) and Article 16(4A) and to the principle	that
where  a power is coupled with a duty as in Julius Vs.	Lord
Bishop	and  Commissioner of Police Vs.	 Gordhandas  Bhanji,
the  same could be enforced by the Court. But we may  point
out that even in Kuldeep Singh's case, no reference was made
to  C.A.  Rajendran and other cases.  We, accordingly,	hold
that  the view in Jagannathan and Kuldeep Singh's cases that
a  mandamus can be issued either to provide for	 reservation
or  for	 relaxation  is	 not correct  and  runs	 counter  to
judgments  of  earlier Constitution Benches and,  therefore,
these  two  judgments cannot be said to be laying  down	 the
correct law.



	  Balancing  of	 fundamental  rights  under  Article
16(1)  and the rights of reserved candidates under  Articles
16(4) and 16(4A):

 Having  noticed  that Article 16(1) deals  with  a
fundamental  right and Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A)	 are
enabling  provisions, we next come to the need for balancing
Article	 16(1)	and  Articles  16(4)  and  16(4A).   Such  a
balancing principle was enunciated by the Constitution Bench
in  1963 in M.R.  Balaji Vs.  State of Mysore :	 1963 Suppl.
(1)  SCR 439 wherein it was stated that the interests of the
reserved  classes must be balanced against the interests  of
other segments of society.  In Indira Sawhney's case, Jeevan
Reddy,	J.   explained	how  the fundamental  right  of	 the
citizens  as  declared in Article 16(1) has to	be  balanced
against	 the  claims of the reserved candidates	 in  Article
16(4).	The learned Judge stated:  (See page 734 para 808):",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles  15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article   15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article   15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article   15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article   15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



60. Shri  G.E.   Vahanvati,   learned  Solicitor  General of   India  appearing  



on behalf of the Union of India, submitted that the argument of Shri 


Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel that the American doctrine of 


""strict scrutiny"" should be applied to the affirmative action envisaged 


under Article 15(5) is not correct.   It was  argued that the impugned 


legislation is not  ex facie  discriminatory and, therefore, it cannot be 


classified as a ""suspect legislation"". It was argued that right that from  


the case of                     T
                                he General Manager    S

Subba Rao. J. (as he then was) said that ""the expression `nothing in  


this article'   is a legislative device to express its intention in a most  


emphatic way that the power conferred there under is not limited in  


any way by the main provision but falls outside it"" . The view that 


Articles   15(4)   and   16(4)   are   exceptions   to   Article   15(1)   and   16(1)  


respectively   was   again   reiterated   in  Triloki   Nath  Vs.    State   of 


Jammu   &   Kashmir   &   Ors.   (II)22    and   in  The   State   of   Andhra 


Pradesh & Ors.     Vs.   U.S.V. Balram, Etc23. The learned Solicitor 


General further pointed out that in  State of Kerala & Anr.  Vs   N.M. 


Thomas & Ors.24   the majority opinion held that Articles 14, 15 and  


16   are   parts   of   the   scheme   of   equality   and   that   Articles   15(4)   and  


16(4) are not exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively. The  


said change in  N.M. Thomas's case  (supra) was noticed by Justice 


Chinnappa   Reddy   in  K.C.   Vasanth   Kumar   &   Anr.      Vs.    State   of 


Karnataka25    and   the   same   view   was   upheld   in  Indra   Sawhney's 


case   (supra).     The   learned   Solicitor   General   further   contended   that 


once it is accepted that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are not exceptions to  


Articles   15(1)   and   16(1)   respectively,   then   there   is   no   question   of

treating the social welfare measure as being `facially discriminatory'  


or  ""ex facie""  violative of the rule of equality.  It was argued that it is  


not simply a matter of legal equality.  De jure equality must ultimately 


find its  raison d'etre  in  de facto  equality.   The State must, therefore, 


resort   to   compensatory   State   action   for   the   purpose   of   uplifting 


people who are factually unequal in their wealth, education or social  


environment. Relying on the observations of Subba Rao, J. in        T. 


Devadasan's case (supra), it was argued that centuries of calculated 


oppression   and   habitual   submission   has   reduced   a   considerable 


section of our community to a life of serfdom and it would be well nigh 


impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of equal opportunity 


was   strictly   enforced   in   their   case   and   they   would   not   have   any 


change   if   they   were   made   to   enter   the   open   field   of   competition 


without adventitious aids till such time when they could stand on their  


own   legs. Laying   reliance   on   the   observations   made   in  N.M. 


Thomas's case (supra) and also in  Indra Sawhney's case (supra), 


the   learned   Solicitor   General   argued   that   under   Articles   15(4)   and 


16(4) the State is obliged to remove inequalities and backwardness 


from society. It was further submitted that the American doctrine of

Chaudri   &   Ors.    Vs.      Union   of   India   &   Ors.26      As   regards 


identification   of   backward   classes,   the   learned   Solicitor   General  


contended   that   while   dealing   with   the   aspect   of   identification   of 


backwardness   for   socially   and   educationally   backward   classes,   it 


cannot   be   denied   that   there   is   backwardness   in   this   country;   that 


large sections of the country are socially and educationally backward;

                                               ltra vires ?

98. The   next   contention   raised   by   the   petitioner's   Counsel   is   that 



Article 15(4) and 15(5) are mutually exclusive and contradictory.  The 


Counsel   for   the   petitioner,   particularly   the   petitioner   in   Writ   Petition  


(C) No. 598 of 2006, submitted that Article 15(4) was a provision and  


a source  of  legislative  power  for the purpose of making reservation  


for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) as well as 


for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) of citizens 


in   aided   minority   educational   institutions.     And   Article   15(4)   was 


inserted after the decision of this Court in  Champakam Dorairajan 


(supra)   and   Article   15(5)   provides   for   reservation   of   seats   for   SCs,  


STs   and   SEBCs   in   aided   or   unaided   educational   institutions   but 


expressly   excludes   all   such   reservation   being   made   in   minority 


educational   institutions   covered   by   Article   30(1)   of   the   Constitution.



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article   15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article   15(5)   would   include   Article   15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.",
Article 4,"Union Of India And Anr vs Azadi Bachao Andolan And Anr on 7 October, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1960330/?formInput=Article%204,,"Some of the salient provisions of the Agreement need to be 
noticed at this juncture. The  Agreement defines a number of terms 
used therein and also contains a residuary clause.  In the 
application of the provisions of the Agreement by the contracting 
States any term not defined therein shall, unless the context 
otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has  under the laws 
in force in that contracting State, relating to the words which are 
the subject of the convention.  Article 1(e) defines 'person' so as to 
include an individual, a company and any other entity, corporate or 
non-corporate ""which is treated as a  taxable unit under the 
taxation laws in force in the respective contracting States"". The 
Central Government in the Ministry of Finance (Department of 
Revenue), in the case of India, and the Commissioner of Income 
Tax in the case of Mauritius, are defined as the ""competent 
authority"".  Article 4 provides the scope of  application of the 
Agreement.  The applicability of the Agreement is determined by 
Article 4 which reads as under;



	In our view,   this thinking of the High Court is erroneous. 
The only restriction on the power of the CBDT is to prevent it 
from interfering  with the course of assessment of any particular 
assessee or the discretion of the Commissioner of Income-Tax 
(Appeals). It would be useful to recall the background against 
which this circular was issued. 

The Income-tax authorities were seeking to examine  as to 
whether the assessees were actually residents of a third country on 
the basis of alleged control of management therefrom.  
We have already extracted the relevant provisions of Article
4 which provide that, for the purposes of the agreement, the term 
'resident of a contracting State' means any person who under the 
laws of that State is liable to taxation therein by reason of his 
domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of 
similar nature.  The term 'resident of India' and 'the resident of 
Mauritius' are to be construed accordingly.  Article 13 of the 
DTAC lays down detailed rules with regard to taxation of capital 
gains. As far as capital gains resulting from alienation of shares are 
concerned, Article 13(4) provides  that the gains derived by a 
'resident' of a contracting State  shall be taxable only in that State. 
In the instant case, such capital gains derived by a resident of 
Mauritius shall be taxable only in Mauritius.  Article 4, which we 
have already referred to, declares that the term resident of 
Mauritius' means any person who under the laws of Mauritius is 
'liable to taxation' therein by reason, inter alia, of his residence. 
Clause (2) of Article 4 enumerates detailed rules as to how the 
residential status of an individual resident in both contracting 
States has to be determined for the purposes of DTAC.  Clause(3) 
of Article 4 provides that if, after application of the detailed rules 
provided in Article 4, it is found that a person other than an 
individual is a resident of both the contracting States, then it shall 
be deemed to be a resident of the contracting State  in which its 
place of effective management is situated.  The DTAC requires the 
test of 'place of effective management' to be applied only for the 
purposes of the tie-breaker  clause in Article 4(3) which could be 
applied only when it is found that a person other than an individual 
is a resident both of  India  and Mauritius.  We see no purpose or 
justification in the DTAC for application of this test in any other 
situation.  



	Some of the assumptions underlying this contention, which 
prevailed with the High Court, need greater critical appraisal.
	Article 13(4) of the DTAC  provides that gains derived by a 
resident of a Contracting State from alienation of any property, 
other than those specified in the paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the 
Article, shall be taxable only in that State. Since most of the 
arguments centred around capital gains made on transactions in 
shares on the stock exchange in India, we may leave out of 
consideration capital gains on the type of properties contemplated 
in paras 1, 2 and 3 of Article 13 of the DTAC. The residuary clause 
in para 4 of Article 13 is relevant.  It provides that capital gains 
made on sale of shares shall be taxable only in the State of which 
the person is a 'resident' taking us back to the meaning of the term 
'resident' of a contracting State.  According to Article 4, this 
expression means any person who under the laws of that State is 
""liable to taxation"" therein by reason of his domicile, residence, 
place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.  
The terms 'resident of India' and 'resident of Mauritius' are 
required to be construed accordingly.  This takes us to the test to 
determine when a company is 'liable to taxation' in Mauritius. 



	There is a further reason in support of our view. The 
expression 'liable to taxation' has been adopted from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
Council (OECD) Model Convention 1977.  The OECD 
commentary on article 4, defining 'resident', says: ""Conventions 
for the avoidance of double taxation do not normally concern 
themselves with the domestic laws of the Contracting States laying 
down the conditions under which a person is to be treated fiscally 
as ""resident"" and, consequently, is fully liable to tax in that State"". 
The expression used is 'liable to tax therein', by reasons of various 
factors.  This definition has been carried over even in Article 4 
dealing with 'resident' in the OECD Model Convention 1992.",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles  15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article   15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article   15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article   15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article   15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



45.    As   regards   exemption   of   minority   educational   institutions   in 


Article 15(5), it was contended that this was done to conform with the  


Constitutional   mandate   of   additional   protection   for   minorities   under 


Article 30.   It was argued that Article 15(5) does not override Article  


15(4).     They   have   to   be   read   together   as   supplementary   to   each 


other   and   Article   15(5)   being   an   additional   provision,   there   is   no  


conflict between Article 15(4) and Article 15(5). Article 15(4), 15(5), 


29(2),   30(1),   and   30(2)   all   together   constitute   a   Code   in   relation   to 


admission to educational institutions.  They have to be harmoniously  


construed in the light of the Preamble and Part IV of the Constitution. 



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article   15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article   15(5)   would   include   Article   15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.  



Article   15(5)   also   to   be   taken  as   an   enabling   provision   to   carry  out  


certain constitutional mandate and thus it is constitutionally valid and 


the contentions raised on these grounds are rejected.

3.     Whether exclusion of minority educational institutions from 


Article 15(5) is violative of Article 14 of Constitution?

101. Another contention raised by the petitioner's Counsel is that the 


exclusion of minority institutions under Article 15(5) itself is violative  


of Article 14 of the Constitution.  It was contended that the exclusion 


by itself is not severable from the rest of the provision.  This plea also  


is   not   tenable   because   the   minority   institutions   have   been   given   a  


separate   treatment   in   view   of   Article   30   of   Constitution.     Such  


classification has been held to be in accordance with the provisions 


of the Constitution.  The exemption of minority educational institutions  


has been allowed to conform Article 15(5) with the mandate of Article 


30 of the Constitution.  Moreover, both Article 15(4) and Article 15(5) 


are operative and the plea of non-severability is not applicable.",
Article 5,"K.M. Abdulla Kunhi And B.L. Abdul Khader vs Union Of India And Ors., State Of ... on 23 January, 1991",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1355334/?formInput=Article%205,,"There are two constitutional safeguards, namely, clause
(4) of Article 22, and clause (5) of Article 22.  the former
requires  that	if a detenu is liable to be detained  for  a
longer period than three months, his case shall be  referred
to   the  Advisory  Board  which  must	report	before	 the
expiration of the said period of three months that there  is
in  its	 opinion sufficient cause for such  detention.	 The
function  of  the Board is purely advisory  and	 its  report
will enable the Government to detain the person beyond three
months	provided  the detention is valid on its	 merits	 and
does not otherwise offend the Constitution.   Clause (5)  of
Article	 22  provides that when any person  is	detained  in
pursuance  of  an order made under any	law  providing	 for
preventive  detention the authority making the order  shall,
as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on
which  the  order  has been made and shall  afford  him	 the
earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.



						     110
 Section 10 prescribes the maximum period for which	 any
person	may be detained.  Section 11 provides power  to	 the
State  Government  or the Central Government to	 revoke	 the
detention  order  without  prejudice to	 the  provisions  of
Section 21 of the General Clauses Act. This revocation shall
not bar the making of another detention order under  section
3 against the same person.
     It	 is  now  beyond the pale of  controversy  that	 the
constitutional right to make representation under clause  (5)
of  Article  22	 by  necessary	implication  guarantees	 the
constitutional	 right to a proper  consideration   of	 the
representation.	 Secondly, the obligation of the  Government
to   afford   to   the	detenu	an   opportunity   to	make
representation	and  to	 consider  such	 representation	 is
distinct from the Government's obligation to refer the	case
of  detenu  along with the representation  to  the  Advisory
Board to enable it to form its opinion and send a report  to
the  Government.   It is implicit in clauses (4) and (5)  of
Article 22 that the Government while discharging its duty to
consider the representation, cannot depend upon the views of
the  Board  on such representation.  It has to consider	 the
representation	on its own without being influenced  by	 any
such view of the Board.	 The obligation of the Government to
consider the representation is different from the obligation
of  the Board to consider the representation at the time  of
hearing	 the  references.   The	 Government  considers	 the
representation to ascertain essentially whether the order is
in  conformity with the power under the law.  The Board,  on
the other hand, considers the representation and the case of
the  detenu to examine whether there is sufficient case	 for
detention.  The consideration by the Board is an  additional
safeguard  and	not a substitute for consideration  of	the
representation	by  the Government.  The right to  have	 the
representation considered by the Government, is, safeguarded
by  cl.	 (5)  of Article 22 and it  is	independent  of	 the
consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by
the  Advisory  Board  under cl. (4) of	Art.  22  read	with
section	 8(c)  of the Act. (See: Sk. Abdul Karim &  Ors.  v.
State  of  West	 Bengal,  [1969] 1  SCC	 433;  Pankaj  Kumar
Chakrabarty  &	Ors. v. State of west Bengal, [1970]  1	 SCR

of West Bengal and Ors.,[1975] 1 SCR 778.



     The  representation  relates  to  the  liberty  of	 the
individual, the highly cherished right enshrined in  Article
21 of our Constitution.
					     111
Clause (5) of Article 22 therefore, casts a legal obligation
on the Government to consider the representation as early as
possible.  it  is a constitutional  mandate  commanding	 the
concerned   authority  to  whom	 the  detenu   submits	 his
representation to consider the representation and dispose of
the  same as expeditiously as possible.	 The words ""as	soon
as may be"" occuring in clause (5) of Article 22 reflects the
concern	 of the Framers that the representation	  should  be
expeditiously  considered  and disposed of with a  sense  of
urgency	 without an avoidable delay.  However, there can  be
no  hard  and fast rule in this regard it depends  upon	 the
facts  and circumstances of each case.	There is  no  period
prescribed  either  under  the	Constitution  or  under	 the
concerned  detention  law, within which	 the  representation
should	be  dealt with.	 The requirement  however,  is	that
there should not be supine indifference slackness or callous
attitude in considering the representation.  Any unexplained
delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of
the  constitutional  imperative	 and  it  would	 render	 the
continued  detention  impermissible and illegal.   This	 has
been  emphasised and re-emphasised by a series of  decisions
of  the	 Court.	 (See: Jayanarayan Sukul v.  State  of	West
bengal,	 {1970]	 1 SCC 219; Frances Coralie Mullin  v.	W.C.
Kambra	and  Ors., [1980] 2 SCC 275; Rama Dhondu  Borade  v.
V.K.  Saraf, Commissioner of Police and Ors., [1989]  3	 SCC
173 and Aslam Ahmed Zahire Ahmed Shaik v. Union of India and
ors., [1989] 3 SCC 277.



     It is necessary to mention that with regard to  liberty
of  citizen  the  Court	 stands guard  over  the  facts	 and
requirement  of	 law,  but  Court  cannot  draw	 presumption
against any authority without material.	 It may be borne  in
mind  that the confirmation of detention does  not  preclude
the  Government	 from revoking the order of  detention	upon
considering  the  representation.  Secondly,  there  may  be
cases	where	the   Government   has	 to   consider	 the
representation only after confirmation of detention.  Clause
(5) of Article 22 suggests that the representation could  be
received even after confirmation of the order

of  detention.	 The words 'shall afford  him  the  earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the order'  in
clause (5) of Article 22 suggest that the obligation of	 the
Government is to offer the detenu an opportunity of making a
representation	against	 the order, before it  is  confirmed
according to the procedure laid down under Section 8 of	 the
Act.  But if the detenu does not exercise his right to	make
representation	at  that  stage,  but  presents	 it  to	 the
government  after the Government has confirmed the order  of
detention,  the	 Government  still  has	 to  consider	such
representation	and release the detenu if the  detention  is
not  within  the  power conferred under	 the  statute.	 The
confirmation  ofthe order of detention is not conclusive  as
against	 the  detenu.	It can be  revoked  suo	 motu  under
Section 11 or upon a representation of the detenu.  It seems
to  us	therefore,  that so long as  the  representation  is
independently  considered by the Government and if there  is
no  delay in considering the representation, the  fact	that
it  is considered after the confirmation of detention  makes
little	difference  on	the validity  of  the  detention  or
confirmation  of the detention.	 The confirmation cannot  be
invalidated solely on the ground that the representation  is
considered subsequent to confirmation of the detention.	 Nor
it  could  be  presumed that such consideration	 is  not  an
independent  consideration.   With all respect, we  are	 not
inclined  to subscribe to the views expressed in V.J.  Jain.
Om  Prakash  Bahl and Khairul Haque cases.  They  cannot  be
considered to be good law and hence stand overruled.",

(i) whether a  monopoly	  for  the  manufacture,  trade	  or
business in liquor can be created in favour of the State and
(ii) whether reasonable restrictions under Article     19(6)
of the Constitution can be placed only by Act of Legislature
or by a	  subordinate legislation as well.
   9.  It is contended that the State cannot carry on  trade
in liquor under	 Article 47 of the Constitution. If the	 law
on the subject is considered to be law under Article  19(6),
it  has	 to  be	 on  the basis that  a	citizen	 had  got  a
fundamental  right to trade in liquor. If the law is that  a
citizen has no fundamental right, then Article 19(6)  cannot
be applied because the said   article applies only to  those
rights which a citizen possesses. What a citizen  cannot  do
under  Article	19(1),	the State cannot  do  under  Article
19(6).	  Secondly,  it is submitted that assuming that	 the
State has got the power to    carry   on  trade	 in   liquor
dehors	 Article  19(6)	 and  under  Article  298   of	 the
Constitution,  the power under Article 298 cannot extend  to
trade in liquor.    This is so because the Union  Government
has no executive power to trade in	a  commodity   which
under Article 47 it is enjoined to prohibit.



""301.	Freedom of trade, commerce and	intercourse.-Subject
to  the other provisions of this part, trade,  commerce	 and

The  right given by this article to freely carry  on  trade,
commerce and  intercourse throughout the territory of  India
is  undisputedly subject to the same restrictions as is	 the
right under Article 19(1)(g).

17.Apart  from	the restrictions placed on the	right  under

articles, so far as they are relevant for our purpose,	read
together, therefore, make the position clear that the  right
conferred  by  Article	19(1)(g) is  not  absolute.   It  is
subject	 to restrictions imposed by the other provisions  of
the   Constitution.   Those  provisions	 are  contained	  in
Articles 19(6), 47, 302, 303, 304 and 305.



53.  The  aforesaid  decisions pertaining to  the  trade  or
business in denatured spirit or industrial alcohol, not only
do  not	 take the view that the citizen	 has  a	 fundamental
right  to carry on trade or business in potable alcohol	 but
on  the contrary, hold that he has no such right.   This  is
reiterated in the two Synthetics & Chemicals cases29 and 30.
54.  It	 will thus be obvious that all the decisions  except
the decision in K.K. Narula case17 have unanimously held  as
shown  above that there is no fundamental right to carry  on
trade or business in potable liquor sold as a beverage.	  As
pointed out above, the proposition of law which is put in  a
different language in K.K. Narula case17 has been  explained
by the subsequent decisions of this Court including those of
the Constitution Benches.  The proposition of law laid	down
there has to be read in conformity with the proposition laid
down  in that respect by the other decisions of	 this  Court
not only to bring comity in the judicial decisions but	also
to  bring the law in conformity with the provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	The  fundamental  rights  conferred  by	 our
Constitution are not absolute.	Article 19 has to be read as
a  whole.  The fundamental rights enumerated  under  Article
19(1)  are subject to the restrictions mentioned in  clauses
(2)  to (6) of the said article.  Hence, the correct way  to
describe  the fundamental rights under Article 19(1)  is  to
call  them  qualified fundamental rights.  To  explain	this
position  in  law, we may take the same illustration  as  is
given in K. K. Narula case 17. The citizen has undoubtedly a
fundamental right to carry on business in ghee.	 But he	 has
no fundamental right to do business in adulterated ghee.  To
expound	 the  theme  further,  a citizen  has  no  right  to
trafficking in women or in slaves or in counterfeit coins or
to   carry   on	 business  of  exhibiting   and	  publishing
pornographic   or   obscene  films  and	  literature.	 The
illustrations  can be multiplied.  This is so because  there
are  certain  activities which are  inherently	vicious	 and
pernicious  and are condemned by all civilised	communities.
So  also, there are goods, articles and services  which	 are
obnoxious  and injurious to the health, morals,	 safety	 and
welfare	 of  the  general public.  To  contend	that  merely
because some

activities and trafficking in some goods can be organised as
a trade or business, right to carry on trade or business  in
the same should be considered a fundamental right is to	 beg
the  question.	The correct interpretation to be  placed  on
the expression ""the right to practise any profession, or  to
carry on any occupation, trade or business"" is to  interpret
it to mean the right to practise any profession or to  carry
on   any  occupation,  trade  or  business  which   can	  be
legitimately  pursued  in  a  civilised	 society  being	 not
abhorrent  to  the  generally  accepted	 standards  of	 its
morality.   Human perversity knows no limits and it  is	 not
possible  to enumerate all professions, occupations,  trades
and  businesses which may be obnoxious to  decency,  morals,
health,	 safety and welfare of the society.  This  is  apart
from  the  fact	 that under  our  Constitution	the  implied
restrictions  on the right to practise any profession or  to
carry on any occupation, trade or business are made explicit
in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution	 and
the  State  is permitted to make law for imposing  the	said
restrictions.  In the present case, it will be clause (6) of
Article	 19  which places restrictions	on  the	 fundamental
right	to  do	business  under	 Article  19(1)(g).    These
restrictions  and  limitations	on  fundamental	 right	 are
implicit  and inherent even in the fundamental rights  spelt
out  in	 the American Constitution, although  they  are	 not
explicitly  stated as in our Constitution by clauses (2)  to
(6)  of Article 19.  That is how the American Supreme  Court
has  read  and	interpreted  the  rights  in  the   American
Constitution  as pointed out above by the excerpts from	 the
relevant  decisions.   It will have, therefore, to  be	held
that  even  under  the American Constitution,  there  is  no
absolute  fundamental right to do business or trade  in	 any
commodity  or service.	The correct way, therefore, to	read
the fundamental rights enumerated under Article 19(1) of our
Constitution is to hold that the citizens do not possess the
said  rights  absolutely.   They have  the  said  rights  as
qualified  by the respective clauses (2) to (6)	 of  Article



63.  One  of the incidental contentions, viz.,	whether	 the
State  can create monopoly in trade or business	 in  potable
liquor	is already answered above.  This is apart  from	 the
fact that Article 19(6) provides for such monopoly in favour
of  the	 State	even  in trades	 and  businesses  which	 are
legitimate.  It is not, therefore, necessary to dilate	upon
this aspect any further.
64.  The  last	contention  in these groups  of	 matters  is
whether	 the State, can place restrictions  and	 limitations
under  Article	19(6) by subordinate  legislation.   Article
13(3)(a)  of the Constitution states that law includes	""any
ordinance,  order, bye-law, rule, regulation,  notification,
custom	or usage having in the territory of India the  force
of  law"".   Clauses  (2)  to (6)  of  Article,	19  make  no
distinction between the law made by the legislature and	 the
subordinate  legislation  for  the purpose  of	placing	 the
restrictions  on the exercise of the respective	 fundamental
rights	mentioned  in  Article	19(1)(a)  to  (g).   We	 are
concerned in the present case with clause (6) of Article 19.
It will be apparent from the said clause that it only speaks
of ""operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes ...""",
Article 6,"Society For Un-Aided P.School Of Raj vs U.O.I & Anr on 12 April, 2012",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/154958944/?formInput=Article%206,,"10.    Coming to the principle of reasonableness,  it  may  be  stated,
    that though subject-wise, Article 21A deals with access to education as
    against right to establish and administer  educational  institution  in
    Article 19(1)(g), it is now not open to anyone to contend that the  law
    relating to right to access education within Article 21A does not  have
    to  meet  the  requirement  of  Article  14  or  Article  19  for   its
    reasonableness.  [See Khudiram Das v. State of West Bengal reported  in
    (1975) 2 SCR 832]  After the judgment of this Court in Maneka Gandhi v.
    Union of India [(1978) 1 SCC 248], the principle of  reasonableness  is
    applicable to Article 14 of the Constitution. As held by this Court in
    Glanrock Estate Private Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu [(2010)  10  SCC
    96], Article 21 (right to life) remains the core  of  the  Constitution
    around which Article 14, Article  19  and  others  revolve.   In  other
    words, all other fundamental rights in Part III would be dependent upon
    right to life in Article 21 as interpreted by  this  Court  to  include
    right to live with dignity, right to education, etc.  At the end of the
    day, whether one adopts the pith and substance test or the  nature  and
    character of the legislation test or the effect test,  one  finds  that
    all these tests have evolved as  rules  of  interpretation  only  as  a
    matter of reasonableness. They help us to correlate  Article  21  with
    Article 14, Article 19 and, so on.  Applying  the  above  principle  of
    reasonableness, though the right to access education falls as a subject
    matter under Article 21A and though  to  implement  the  said  Article,
    Parliament has enacted the 2009 Act, one has to judge the  validity  of
    the said Act in the light of the principle of reasonableness in Article
    19(6), particularly, when in T.M.A. Pai Foundation and in P.A.  Inamdar
    v. State of Maharashtra [(2005) 6 SCC 537], it has been held that right
    to establish and administer  an  educational  institution  falls  under
    Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.  Thus, the question which  arises
    for determination is – whether Section 12(1)(c) of the 2009  Act  is  a
    reasonable restriction on the non-minority’s  right  to  establish  and
    administer an unaided  educational  institution  under  Article  19(6)?
Article 21 says that “no person shall be deprived of his  life...except
    according to the procedure established by law” whereas Article 19(1)(g)
    under the chapter “right to freedom” says that all  citizens  have  the
    right to practice any profession or to carry on any  occupation,  trade
    or business which freedom is not absolute but which could be  subjected
    to social control under  Article  19(6)  in  the  interest  of  general
    public.  By judicial decisions, right to education has been  read  into
    right to life in Article 21.  A child who is  denied  right  to  access
    education is not only deprived of his right to live with dignity, he is
    also deprived  of  his  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and  expression
    enshrined in Article 19(1)(a).  The 2009 Act seeks to remove all  those
    barriers including financial and psychological barriers which  a  child
    belonging to the weaker section and disadvantaged  group  has  to  face
    while seeking admission.  It is  true  that,  as  held  in  T.M.A.  Pai
    Foundation as  well  as  P.A.  Inamdar,  the  right  to  establish  and
    administer an educational institution is a fundamental right,  as  long
    as the activity remains charitable under Article 19(1)(g), however,  in
    the said two decisions the correlation between Articles 21 and 21A,  on
    the one hand, and  Article  19(1)(g),  on  the  other,  was  not  under
    consideration.  Further, the content of Article 21A flows from  Article
    45 (as it then stood).  The 2009 Act has been enacted to give effect to
    Article 21A.  For the above reasons, since the Article  19(1)(g)  right
    is not an absolute right as Article  30(1),  the  2009  Act  cannot  be
    termed as unreasonable.  To put  an  obligation  on  the  unaided  non-
    minority school to admit 25% children in class I under Section 12(1)(c)
    cannot be termed as an unreasonable restriction.  Such a law cannot  be
    said to transgress any constitutional limitation.  The  object  of  the
    2009 Act is to remove the barriers faced by a child who seeks admission
    to class I and not to restrict the freedom under Article 19(1)(g).  The
    next question that  arises  for  determination  is  –  whether  Section
    12(1)(c) of the 2009 Act impedes  the  right  of  the  non-minority  to
    establish and administer an unaided educational  institution?   At  the
    outset, it may be noted that Article 19(6) is  a  saving  and  enabling
    provision in the Constitution as it empowers the Parliament to  make  a
    law imposing reasonable restriction on the Article  19(1)(g)  right  to
    establish and administer an educational institution while  Article  21A
    empowers the Parliament to enact a law as to the manner  in  which  the
    State will discharge its obligation to provide for free and  compulsory
    education.  If the Parliament enacts the law, pursuant to Article  21A,
    enabling the State to access the network (including infrastructure)  of
    schools including unaided non-minority schools would such a law be said
    to be unconstitutional, not saved under Article 19(6)?   Answer  is  in
    the negative.  Firstly, it must be noted that the expansive  provisions
    of the 2009 Act are intended not only to guarantee the  right  to  free
    and compulsory education to children, but to set up an intrinsic regime
    of providing right to  education  to  all  children  by  providing  the
    required  infrastructure  and  compliance  of  norms   and   standards.
    Secondly, unlike other  fundamental  rights,  the  right  to  education
    places a burden not only on the State, but also on the parent/ guardian
    of every child [Article 51A(k)].  The Constitution directs both burdens
    to achieve one end: the compulsory education of children free from  the
    barriers of  cost,  parental  obstruction  or  State  inaction.   Thus,
    Articles 21A and 51A(k) balance the relative burdens on the parents and
    the State.   Thus,  the  right  to  education  envisages  a  reciprocal
    agreement  between  the  State  and  the  parents  and  it  places   an
    affirmative burden on all stakeholders in our civil society.   Thirdly,
    right to establish an educational institution has now  been  recognized
    as a fundamental right within the meaning of  Article  19(1)(g).   This
    view is enforced by the opinion of this Court in T.M.A. Pai  Foundation
    and P.A. Inamdar that all  citizens  have  a  right  to  establish  and
    administer educational institutions under Articles 19(1)(g) and 26  but
    that right is subject to the provisions of Articles  19(6)  and  26(a).
    The constitutional obligation of the State  to  provide  for  free  and
    compulsory education to the  specified  category  of  children  is  co-
    extensive with the fundamental right guaranteed under Article  19(1)(g)
    to establish an educational institution.  Lastly, the fundamental right
    to establish an educational institution cannot  be  confused  with  the
    right to ask  for  recognition  or  affiliation.   The  exercise  of  a
    fundamental  right  to  establish   and   administer   an   educational
    institution can be controlled in a number  of  ways.   Indeed,  matters
    relating to the right to grant of recognition and/ or  affiliation  are
    covered within the realm of statutory right, which, however, will  have
    to satisfy the test of reasonable  restrictions  [see  Article  19(6)].
    Thus, from the scheme of Article 21A and the 2009 Act, it is clear that
    the primary obligation  is  of  the  State  to  provide  for  free  and
    compulsory education to children between the age of 6 to 14 years  and,
    particularly, to children who are likely to be prevented from  pursuing
    and completing the elementary education due to inability to afford fees
    or charges.  Correspondingly, every citizen has a  right  to  establish
    and administer educational institution under Article 19(1)(g)  so  long
    as the activity remains charitable.  Such an activity undertaken by the
    private institutions supplements the primary obligation of  the  State.
    Thus, the State can regulate by  law  the  activities  of  the  private
    institutions by imposing reasonable restrictions under  Article  19(6).
    The 2009 Act not only encompasses the aspects of right of  children  to
    free and compulsory education but to carry out the  provisions  of  the
    2009 Act, it also deals with the matters pertaining to establishment of
    school (s) as also grant of recognition (see section 18).  Thus,  after
    the commencement of the 2009 Act, the private management  intending  to
    establish the school has to make  an  application  to  the  appropriate
    authority and till the certificate is granted  by  that  authority,  it
    cannot establish or run the school.  The matters relevant for the grant
    of recognition are also provided for in Sections 19, 25 read  with  the
    Schedule to the Act.  Thus, after the commencement of the 2009 Act,  by
    virtue of Section 12(1)(c) read with Section 2(n)(iv), the State, while
    granting recognition to the private unaided  non-minority  school,  may
    specify permissible  percentage  of  the  seats  to  be  earmarked  for
    children who may not be in a position to pay their fees or charges.  In
    T.M.A. Pai Foundation, this Court vide para 53 has  observed  that  the
    State while prescribing  qualifications  for  admission  in  a  private
    unaided institution may provide for condition of  giving  admission  to
    small percentage of  students  belonging  to  weaker  sections  of  the
    society by giving them freeships, if not  granted  by  the  government.
    Applying the said law, such a condition  in  Section  12(1)(c)  imposed
    while granting recognition to the private unaided  non-minority  school
    cannot be termed as unreasonable.  Such a condition would  come  within
    the principle of reasonableness in Article 19(6).  Indeed, by virtue of
    Section 12(2) read with Section 2(n)(iv), private unaided school  would
    be entitled to be reimbursed with the expenditure  incurred  by  it  in
    providing free and compulsory education to children  belonging  to  the
    above category to the extent of per child expenditure incurred  by  the
    State in a school specified in Section 2(n)(i)  or  the  actual  amount
    charged from the child, whichever is less.  Such a  restriction  is  in
    the  interest  of  the  general  public.   It  is  also  a   reasonable
    restriction.  Such measures address two aspects,  viz.,  upholding  the
    fundamental right of the private management  to  establish  an  unaided
    educational institution of their choice and, at the same time, securing
    the interests of the children in the locality, in particular, those who
    may not be able to pursue education due to inability  to  pay  fees  or
    charges of the private unaided schools. We also do not see any merit in
    the contention that Section 12(1)(c) violates Article  14.  As  stated,
    Section 12(1)(c) inter alia provides for admission to class I,  to  the
    extent of 25% of the strength of the class, of the  children  belonging
    to weaker section and disadvantaged  group  in  the  neighbourhood  and
    provide free and compulsory  elementary  education  to  them  till  its
    completion.  The  emphasis  is  on  “free  and  compulsory  education”.
    Earmarking of seats for children belonging to a specified category  who
    face financial barrier in the matter of accessing  education  satisfies
    the test of classification in Article  14.  Further,  Section  12(1)(c)
    provides for level playing field in the matter of right to education to
    children who are prevented from accessing education because they do not
    have the means or their parents do not have the means to pay for  their
    fees. As stated above, education  is  an  activity  in  which  we  have
    several participants. There are number of stakeholders including  those
    who want to establish and administer educational institutions as  these
    supplement the primary obligation of the State to provide for free  and
    compulsory education to the  specified  category  of  children.  Hence,
    Section 12(1)(c) also satisfies the test of reasonableness, apart  from
    the test of classification in Article 14.



    48.      Right to work does not oblige the State to  provide  work  for
    livelihood which has also been not recognized as a  fundamental  right.
    Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Act 42 of
    2005) guarantees at least 100 days of work in every financial  year  to
    every household whose adult members volunteer manual work on payment of
    minimum wages.  Article 41 of  the  Constitution  provides  that  State
    shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make
    effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to
    public assistance in cases  of  unemployment,  old  age,  sickness  and
    disablement, which right is also reflected  in  Article 6  of  ICESCR.
    Article 38 of Part-IV states that the State shall strive to promote the
    welfare of the people and Article 43 states that it shall endeavour  to
    secure a living wage and a decent standard of life to all workers.   In
    Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Others [(1984) 3 SCC 161], a
    Public Interest Litigation, an NGO highlighted the deplorable condition
    of bonded labourers in a quarry in Haryana.  It was pointed out that  a
    host of protective and welfare oriented labour legislations,  including
    Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act, 1976 and the Minimum Wages Act, 1948were
    not  followed.   This  Court  gave  various  directions  to  the  State
    Government to enable it  to  discharge  its  constitutional  obligation
    towards bonded labourers.  This Court held  that  right  to  live  with
    human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from  the
    Directive Principles of State Policy, particularly clauses (e) and  (f)
    of Article 39 and Articles 41 and 42 and  held  that  it  must  include
    protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women and  of
    the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and  facilities
    for children to develop in  a  healthy  manner  and  in  conditions  of
    freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions
    of work and maternity relief.



 65.       Article 19(6)(i) enables the State to make  law  relating  to
    professional or technical qualifications necessary for  practicing  any
    profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.  Such laws
    can  prevent  unlicensed,  uncertified   medical   practitioners   from
    jeopardizing life and health of people.  Sub  clause  (ii)  to  Article
    19(6) imposes no limits upon  the  power  of  the  State  to  create  a
    monopoly in its favour.  State can also by law  nationalize  industries
    in the interest of general public.  Clause (6)(ii) of Article 19 serves
    as an exception to clause (1)(g) of Article 19 which enable  the  State
    to enact several legislations in nationalizing trades  and  industries.
    Reference may be made to Chapter-4 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1938, The
    Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970,
    General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972 and so on.  Sub-
    clause 6(ii) of Article 19 exempts the  State,  on  the  conditions  of
    reasonableness, by laying down that carrying out any  trade,  business,
    industry or services by the State Government would not be  questionable
    on the ground that it is an infringement on the right guaranteed  under
    Article 19(1)(g).



 74.       Referring to Pai Foundation  case,  the  Court  also  stated,
    having allowed the private sector into the field of education including
    higher education, it would be unreasonable, pursuant to clause  (6)  of
    Article 19, for the State to fix the fees and also impose  reservations
    on private unaided educational institutions.  Nevertheless,  the  Court
    opined that taking into consideration the width of the original  powers
    under Clause (6) of Article 19, one would necessarily have to find  the
    State would at least have the power to  make  amendments  to  resurrect
    some of those powers that it had possessed to  control  the  access  to
    higher education and achieve the goals  of  egalitarianism  and  social
    justice.",

Article 7,"A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1857950/?formInput=Article%207,,"Article  22 (4) opens with a double negative.  Put in  a
positive  form	it will mean that a law which  provides	 for
preventive  detention for a period longer than three  months
shall  contain .a provision establishing an advisory  board,
(consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned  in
sub-clause (a)), and which has to report before the  expira-
tion of three months if in its opinion there was  sufficient
cause for such detention. This clause, if it stood by itself
and  without  the remaining provisions of article  22,	will
apply  both  to the Parliament and the	State  Legislatures.
The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even  though
the  advisory  board may be of the opinion  that  there	 was
sufficient cause for such detention, i.e., detention  beyond
the period of three months, still the detention is not to be
permitted  beyond the maximum period, if any, prescribed  by
Parliament under article 22 (7) (b). Again the whole of this
sub-clause  is	made inoperative by article 22	(4)  (b)  in
respect of an Act of preventive detention passed by  Parlia-
ment  under clauses (7) (a) .and (b).  Inasmuch as  the	 im-
pugned	Act is an Act of the Parliament purported to  be  so
made, clause 22 (4) has no operation and may for the present
discussion  be kept aside. Article 22 prescribes  that	when
any person under a preventive detention law is detained, the
authority making the order shall, as soon as may be,  commu-
nicate	to such person the grounds on which . the order	 has
been made and shall afford him the

earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.	This  clause is of general operation in	 respect  of
every  detention order made under any law permitting  deten-
tion.  Article 22 (6) permits the authority making the order
to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid-
ers  against  the public interest to disclose.	 It  may  be
noticed that this clause only permits the non-disclosure  of
facts,	and reading clauses (5) and (6) together a  distinc-
tion  is  drawn	 between facts	and  grounds  of  detention.
Article 22 (4) and (7) deal not with the period of detention
only  but with other requirements in the case of  preventive
detention  also.  They provide for the establishment  of  an
advisory  board, and the necessity of furnishing grounds  to
the detenue and also to give him a right to make a represen-
tation.	 Reading article 22 clauses (4) and (7) together  it
appears	 to  be implied that preventive detention  for	less
than three months, without  an advisory board, is  permitted
under  the  Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights,  provided	such
legislation  is	 within the legislative	 competence  of	 the
Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be.
    Article  22	 (5) permits the detained person to  make  a
representation.	 The Constitution is silent as to the person
to  whom it has to be made, or how it has to be dealt  with.
But that is the procedure laid down by the Constitution.  It
does not therefore mean that if a law made by the Parliament
in  respect of preventive detention does not make  provision
on those two points it is invalid.  Silence on these  points
does  not  make	 the impugned Act in  contravention  of	 the
Constitution  because  the first question is  what  are	 the
rights	given by the Constitution in the case of  preventive
detention. The contention that the representation should  be
to  an	outside	 body has no support in law.   Even  in	 the
Liversidge  case  the representation had to be made  to	 the
Secretary  of  State and not to another	 body.	 After	such
representation	was  made,  another advisory  board  had  to
consider it, but it was not necessary to make the  represen-
tation	itself	to a third party.  Article 22  (4)  and	 (7)
permit the non-establishment of an advisory board  expressly
in a  parliamentary  legislation-



    It	was argued that section 11 of the impugned  Act	 was
invalid as it permitted the continuance of the detention for
such  period as the Central Government or the State  Govern-
ment thought fit.  This may mean an indefinite period. In my
opinion this argument has nos substance because the Act	 has
to  be read as a whole., The whole life of the Act is for  a
year  and therefore the argument that the detention  may  be
for  an indefinite period is unsound.  Again, by  virtue  of
article 22 (7)(b), the Parliament is not obliged to fix	 the
maximum	 term  of such detention.  It has not so  fixed	 it,
except	under section 12, and therefore it cannot be  stated
that section 11 is in contravention of article 22 (7).
Section  12	 of the impugned Act is	 challenged  on	 the
ground that it does not conform to the provisions of article
22 (7).	 It is argued that article 22 (7) permits preventive
detention  beyond  three months, when  the  Parliament	pre-
scribes ""the circumstances in which, and the class or class-
es  of	cases in which,"" a person may be detained.   It	 was
argued that both these conditions must be fulfilled.  In  my
opinion, this argument is unsound, because the words used in
article	 22 (7) themselves are against such  interpretation.
The  use of the word ""which"" twice in the first part of	 the
sub-clause,  read with the comma put after each, shows	that
the  legislature wanted these to be read as disjunctive	 and
not  conjunctive.   Such argument might have  been  possible
(though	 not  necessarily accepted) if' the article  in	 the
Constitution was ""the circumstances. and the class or class-
es of cases in which  ......  ""I have. no doubt that by	 the
clause, as worded, the legislature-



    Dealing with the four fundamental principles of  natural
justice	 in procedure claimed by the petitioner, it is	thus
clear that in respect of preventive detention no question of
an objective standard of human conduct can be laid down.  It
is  conceded that no notice before detention can be  claimed
by  the	 very nature of such detention.	 The  argument	that
after  detention intimation of the grounds should  be  given
has  been recognised in article 22 (5) and  incorporated  in
the	impugned   Act.	 As regards an	impartial  tribunal,
article	 22 and	 (7)  read  together give  the	  Parliament
ample  discretion.   When  in  specified  circumstances	 and
classes	 of cases the preventive  detention  exceeds   three
months,	 the absence of an advisory board is expressly	per-
mitted

by  article 22 (7). Under article 22 (4) it appears  implied
that  a provision for such tribunal is not necessary if	 the
detention  is  for less than three months.   As	 regards  an
opportunity to be heard, there is no absolute natural  right
recognised  in respect of oral representation.	It has	been
held  to depend on the nature of the tribunal. The right  to
make  a	 representation is affirmed by the  Constitution  in
article	 22 (5) and finds a place in the impugned Act.	 The
right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it  is
guaranteed  by article 22 (4) read with article 22 (7)	(c),
and  by	 article  22  (7) (a) and (b), has  also  been	thus
provided   in  the  Act.   It seems to me therefore that the
petitioner's contentions even on these points fail.
    Section  14 was strongly attacked on the ground that  it
violated  all  principles of natural justice  and  even	 in-
fringed	 the right given by article 22 (5) of the  Constitu-
tion.  It runs as follows:



    It will be noticed that all the subjects of	 legislation
concerning preventive detention occurring in item    of List
I are grouped in sub-clause (1) of clause (a). The  subjects
in  this group are three in number and, for  convenience  of
reference,  I shall hereafter refer to them as A, B  and  C.
In  sub-.clause	 (ii), we find grouped two  of	the  matters
referred  to in item 3 of List III, these being security  of
the  State and the maintenance of public order.	  These	 two
subjects, I shall refer to as D and E. In sub-clause  (iii),
reference  has	been made to the third matter in item  3  of
List III, and I shall refer to this subject as F.  With this
classification, let us now turn to the Constitution itself.
    On reading articles 22 (4) and 22 (7) together, it would
be clear that so long as article 22 (4) (a) holds the  field
and Parliament does not act under clause (7) (a) of  article
22, there must be an advisory board in every case, i.e.,  if
the  legislation relates to groups A to F, as it does  here,
there must be an advisory board for all these groups.
    Article  22 (7) however practically engrafts  an  excep-
tion.  It states in substance that the Parliament may by  an
Act  provide  for preventive detention for more	 than  three
months	without reference to an advisory board, but in	such
cases  it shall be incumbent on the Parliament to  prescribe
(1) the circumstances and (2) the class or classes of  cases
in  which such course is found to be necessary. If the	case
contemplated  in clause (4)(a)is the rule and  that  contem-
plated 'in clause (7) (a) is the exception, then the circum-
stances	 and  the  class or classes of cases must  be  of  a
special or extraordinary nature, so as to take the case	 out
of the rule and bring it within the exception.	It is always

possible to draw the line between the normal or ordinary and
the  abnormal or  extraordinary cases. and this is what,  in
my opinion, the Parliament was	expected to do under  clause
(7)  (a).   I do not think that it was	ever  intended	that
Parliament could at its will treat the normal as the  abnor-
mal  or 'the rule as the exception.  But this  is  precisely
what  has  been done in this case-  All the items  on  which
preventive legislation is possible excepting one, i.e., A to
E,  have  been put within the exception, and  only  one,  F,
which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen-
tial to the community, has been allowed to remain under	 the
rule. In other words, it is provided that there shall be  an
advisory board only for the last category, F, but no  provi-
sion  having been made for the other categories, A to E,  it
may  be assumed that the advisory board has  been  dispensed
with in those cases. The learned Attorney-General maintained
that  it would have been open to the Parliament to  dispense
with the advisory board even for the category F, and if such
a  course  had been adopted it would not have  affected	 the
validity of the Act.  This is undoubtedly a logical position
in  the sense that it was necessary for him to go as far  as
this  to justify his stand; but, in my opinion,	 the  course
adopted	 by  the Parliament in enacting section	 12  of	 the
impugned  Act is not what  is  contemplated  under   article
22 (7)	(a) or is permitted by it.  The	 circumstances to be
prescribed  must be special and extraordinary  circumstances
and  the class or classes of cases must be of the  same	 na-
ture.	In my opinion, the Constitution	 never	contemplated
that  the  Parliament should mechanically reproduce  all  or
most of the categories A to F almost verbatim and not  apply
its  mind to decide in what circumstances and in what  class
or classes of cases the safeguard of an advisory board is to
be dispensed with.",

Income Attributable to PE
16.	Under Article 7, the taxability is of the MNE. What is to 
be taxed under Article 7 is income of the MNE attributable to 
the P.E. in India. The income attributable to the said P.E. is 
the income attributable to foreign company's operations in 
India, which in term, implies the income attributable to the 
activities carried on by the MNE through its P.E. in India. 
Therefore, there is a difference between the taxability of the 
P.E. in respect of its income earned by it in India which is in 
accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 and which has 
nothing to do with the taxability of the MNE, which is also 
taxable in India under Article 7, in respect of the profits 
attributable to its P.E.. Under Article 7, the taxability is of the 
MNE. What is taxable under Article 7 is profits earned by the 
MNE. Under the said IT Act, the taxable unit is the foreign 
company, though the quantum of income taxable is income 
attributable to the P.E. of the said foreign company in India.	



30.	To answer the above question we quote Article 7 of the 
U.N. Model Convention which reads as under:
""ARTICLE 7 :	ATTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS PROFITS

Article 7 of the UN Model Convention states as under:
business profits
1.	The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be 
taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on 
business in the other Contracting State through a 
permanent establishment situated therein.  If the 
enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of 
the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so 
much of them as is attributable to (a) that permanent 
establishment; (b) sales in that other State of goods or 
merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold 
through that permanent establishment; or (c) other 
business activities carried on in that other State of the 
same or similar kind as those effected through that 
permanent establishment.  



31.	Article 7 of the U.N. Model Convention inter alia provides 
that only that portion of business profits is taxable in the 
source country which is attributable to the PE.  It specifies 
how such business profits should be ascertained.  Under the 
said Article, a PE is treated as if it is an independent 
enterprise (profit centre) dehors the head office and which 
deals with the head office at arm's length.  Therefore, its 
profits are determined on the basis as if it is an independent 
enterprise.  The profits of the PE are determined on the basis 
of what an independent enterprise under similar 
circumstances might be expected to derive on its own.  Article
7(2) of the U.N. Model Convention advocates the arm's length 
approach for attribution of profits to a PE.",
Article 7,"Ishikawajma-Harima Heavy Industries ... vs Director Of Income Tax, Mumbai on 4 January, 2007",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/245369/?formInput=Article%207,,"(4)	Whether there is business connection in India 
or/and whether all operations of the business are 
not carried out in India are questions of fact which 
have to be determined on the facts of each case.""  

	Applying the said principles to the facts of the present case, the 
Authority opined that the appellant was liable to pay direct tax even under 
the Treaty having regard to Articles 5 and 7 thereof as also Clause 6 of the 
Protocol.  It was held :

	""The substance of the protocol quoted above, 
represents the consensus reached between the parties to 
the treaty in regard to the meaning of the phrase ""directly 
or indirectly attributable to that permanent 
establishment"" employed in paragraph 1 of article 7.  
Further, profits shall also be regarded as attributable to 
the permanent establishment to the extent indicated in the 
said protocol even when the contract or order relating to 
the sale or provision of goods or services in question is 
made or placed directly with the overseas head office of 
the enterprise rather than with the permanent 
establishment.



	It would be clear that having regard to provisions 
of article 7(1) of the Treaty read with para 6 of the 
protocol supply of equipment of machinery (sale of 
which was completed abroad, having placed the order 
directly overseas office of the enterprise) the same should 
be within the meaning of the phrase directly or indirectly 
attributable to that permanent establishment.""      		

	As regards taxability of the amounts 'received' and 'receivable' by the 
appellant from Petronet for offshore services, it was held :



	5.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall 
not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties or fees 
for technical services, being a resident of a Contracting 
State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in 
which the royalties or fees for technical services arise, 
through a permanent establishment situated therein, or 
performs in that other Contracting State independent 
personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and 
the right, property or contract in respect of which the 
royalties or fees for technical services are paid is 
effectively connected with such permanent establishment 
or fixed base.  In such case, the provisions of article 7 or 
article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.""



(7)	Section 9(1)(vii)(c) of the Act in this case would have no application 
as there is nothing to show that the income derived by a non-resident 
company irrespective of where rendered, was utilized in India. 
(8)	Article 7 of the DTAA is applicable in this case, and it limits the tax 
on business profits to that arising from the operations of the 
permanent establishment. In this case, the entire services have been 
rendered outside India, and have nothing to do with the permanent 
establishment, and can thus not be attributable to the permanent 
establishment and therefore not taxable in India.
(9)	Applying the principle of apportionment to composite transactions 
which have some operations in one territory and some in others, is 
essential to determine the taxability of various operations.
(10)	The location of the source of income within India would not render 
	sufficient nexus to tax the income from that source. 
(11)	If the test applied by the Authority for Advanced Rulings is to be 
adopted here too, then it would eliminate the difference between the 
connection between Indian and foreign operations, and the 
apportionment of income accordingly.",
Article 7,"Gujarat State Financial Corporation vs M/S. Natson Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd. & ... on 29 August, 1978",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1961081/?formInput=Article%207,,"The state of Gujarat set up the Gujarat state Financial
corporation ('Corporation' for short), the appellant herein,
under s. 3 of the Act. The Corporation was set up inter alia
for granting  or guaranteeing  tile loans  to be  raised  by
industrial concerns either from scheduled banks or state co-
operative banks	 or those  floated in the public market. The
Corporation guaranteed	numerous such loans, advanced to the
industrial concerns in the state of Gujarat on certain terms
and  conditions	  agreed  between   the	 parties.  When	 the
industrial concern defaults in repayment of loan or fails to
comply with  the terms	of the	agreement the Corporation is
entitled to make an application to the District Judge within
the limits  of whose  jurisdiction  the	 industrial  concern
carries on the whole or substantial part of its business for
one or	more of	 the reliefs set out in s. 31(1) of the Act.
The  Corporation   appears  to	 have,	 made	applications
purporting to  be under	 s. 31(1)  of  the  Act	 in  various
District Courts	 in the	 State of  Gujarat against different
industrial concerns.  A question  was raised in the District
Courts	about	the  proper   court  fee   payable  on	such
applications. The Corporation contended that the application
would be  governed by Article 1 (of Schedule II o the Bombay
Court) Fee Act, 1959, and a fixed court fee in the amount of
65 paise  would be payable in respect of the application. On
the other  hand, the  State contended that application would
be governed either by

Article I   Schedule  I or  at any  rate  by  Article 7  of
Schedule I  and the court fee payable would be ad valorem on
the amount  of value  of the subject matter in dispute or on
the amount  of the  monetary gain  or loss  to be  prevented
according  to  the  scale  prescribed  under  Article  I  of
Schedule I.  It appears	 that except  for the  Distt. Judge,
Broach, all other District Judges accepted the contention on
behalf of  the State.  The Distt.  Judge, Broach  was of the
opinion that  the application  under s.	 31(1)	was  in	 the
nature of  an execution application and it would be governed
by Article  l(c) of  Schedule II.  The Corporation preferred
revision applications  to the  High  Court  questioning	 the
correctness of	the decisions  directing levy  of ad valorem
court fee.  The State  of Gujarat  also preferred a revision
application against the decision of the Distt. Judge, Broach
holding that  the application under s. 31 (1) of the Act was
in the nature of an execution application. The High Court by
a common  judgment held that the application under s. 31 (1)
should	bear   ad  valorem   court  fee.  In  reaching	this
conclusion the	High Court  treated the application under s.



378
 Article 1	of Schedule I of the Court-fees Act provides
for ad	valorem court  fee on plaint or memorandum of appeal
(not otherwise	provided  for  in  the	Act)  or  of  cross-
objections presented  to any  civil or	revenue court, to be
levied according to the scale set out in the Schedule on the
value of  the subject-matter  in dispute. Article 7 provides
for court-fees	on a plaint or application or petition other
than those  provided  in  the  earlier	Articles  to  obtain
substantive relief  capable of	being  valued  in  terms  of
monetary gain or prevention of monetary loss including cases
where an  application or  petition is  treated either  as  a
plaint or a described as the mode of obtaining the relief as
aforesaid, the	fee to	be calculated  on the  amount of the
monetary gain  or monetary loss to be prevented according to
the scale prescribed under Article 1.



     It was  said that	if cause  is shown by the industrial
concern	 it   is  obligatory   upon  the   Distt.  Judge  to
investigate  the  claim	 of  the  Financial  Corporation  in
accordance with the provision contained in the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, in so far as such provisions may be applied
thereto. The  contention is  that once an industrial concern
shows cause  and contests the application of the Corporation
there arises  a lis  between the parties which would include
the investigation  of the  monetary claim of the Corporation
and per	 se it would be a suit between the mortgagee and the
mortgagor in  which the ultimate relief is sale of mortgaged
property for  repayment of the mortgage money. Sub-s. (6) of
s. 32  of the  Act has to be read in the context in which it
is placed.  The claim of the Corporation is not the monetary
claim to be investigated though it may become necessary to

specify the  figure for	 the purpose of determining how much
of the security should be sold. But the investigation of the
claim does  not involve	 all the  contentions  that  can  be
raised in a suit. The claim of the Corporation is that there
is a  breach of	 agreement or default in making repayment of
loan or	 advance or  instalment thereof	 and, therefore, the
mortgaged property  should be sold. It is not a money claim.
The contest  can  be  that  the	 jurisdictional	 fact  which
enables the  Corporation to  seek  the	relief	of  sale  of
property is  not available  to it or no case is made out for
transfer of management of the industrial concern. Sub-s. (7)
of  s.	32  prescribes	what  reliefs  can  be	given  after
investigation under sub-s. (6) is made, and it clearly gives
a clue to the nature of contest under Sub-s. (6). Sub-s. (8)
of s.  32 only	prescribes the mode and method for executing
the order  of attachment  or sale of property as provided in
the Code  of Civil Procedure. Sub-ss. (6), (7) and (8) of s.
32 read together would give an opportunity to the industrial
concern to  appear and	satisfy the  District Judge what the
situation envisaged  by s.  31(13 has  not  arisen  and	 the
relief should  not be granted. In the absence of a provision
giving such  an opportunity  to the  industrial	 concern  to
whose detriment	 the order is required to be made, a serious
question may  arise about the constitutional validity of the
procedure prescribed  under s. 31(1) inasmuch as it would be
violative of principles of natural justice and that too in a
proceeding in  a Court	of Law.	 The provision	contained in
sub-s. (6)  does not  expand the  contest in the application
made under  s. 31(1)  as to  render the	 application to be a
suit between  a mortgagee,  and the  mortgagor for  sale  of
mortgaged property.  If that  were so, the Corporation would
not be limited to specified reliefs only and if the contract
permits	 it  may  seek	to  enforce  personal  liability  of
mortgage which	it cannot  enforce in  an application  under
Sec. 31	 ( 1). It may be, as contended by Mr. Patel, that in
the ultimate  analysis the result would be that the property
will be	 sold for  repayment of the loan or advance taken by
the, industrial	 concern from  the Corporation	but it could
not be	said that  it is a substantive relief claimed by the
Corporation which can be valued in terms of monetary gain or
prevention of  monetary loss  as envisaged  by Article 7 of
Schedule I  of Court-fees  Act. The substantive relief in an
application  under   s.	 31(1)	 is  something	akin  to  an
application for	 attachment of	property in  execution of  a
decree at a stage posterior to the passing of the decree. We
are unable  to appreciate  the view  taken by the High Court
that the  proceeding is	 not in the nature of execution of a
decree because	the question  of enforcement of the order of
attachment or  sale would  only arise after the same is made
absolute under	Sub-s. (7).  One has  to look  at the  whole
conspectus of provisions in s. 32 coupled with the nature of
relief sought under s. 31(1)

and it	becomes clear  that special  provision is  made	 for
certain	 types	 of  reliefs  that  can	 be  obtained  by  a
Corporation by an application under s. 31(1) which could not
be styled  as substantive  relief for  repayment of mortgage
money by  sale of  mortgaged property. Nor can it be said to
be a  proceeding to  obtain substantive	 relief	 capable  of
being valued  in terms	of monetary  gain or  prevention  of
monetary loss.	The form  of the  application, the nature of
the relief,  the  compulsion  to  make	interim	 order,	 the
limited enquiry	 contemplated by  Sub-s. 6  of s. 32 and the
nature of  relief that	can be	granted and  the  manner  of
execution clearly  show that  the application under s. 31(1)
is neither a plaint as contemplated by Article 1 of Schedule
I nor an application in a nature of a plaint as contemplated
by Article 7 of Schedule I of Court-fees Act.



     Once Article 7 of	 Schedule I of the Court-fees Act is
excluded there	was  (and  could  be)  no  dispute  that  an
application under  s. 31(1)  of the  Act would be covered by
the residuary  Article l(c) of Schedule II of the Court-fees
Act and	 it should  bear a  fixed court fee in the sum of 65
paise. Therefore,  the High  Court was	clearly in  error in
holding that  the application  should bear  ad valorem court
fee.
     When  dealing   with  a  question	of  court  fee,	 the
perspective should  be informed	 by the	 spirit of the magna
carta and  of equal  access to justice which suggests that a
heavy price  tag on  relief in	Court should  be regarded as
unpalatable.",

KAPADIA, J.

1. Leave granted.

2. These civil appeals filed by the Department concern computation of the
profits of the Indian permanent establishment (for short, ""PE"") of the
Korean company, M/s .Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (for short, `HHi').
Assesses is a non-resident foreign company incorporated in South Korea. On
12.3.85 it had entered into an agreement with oil and Natural Gas Company
(for short, `ONGC') for designing, fabrication, hook-up and commissioning
of South Basin field Central Complex facilities in Bombay High. In short
the contract was in two parts, one was for fabrication of platform and the
other was installation and commissioning of the said platform in South
Basses in Field. In these civil appeals we are concerned with the
assessment years 1987-88 and 1988-89. The assesses is incorporated under
the laws of Republic of Korea. Its registered office is in Korea. As
regards assessment year 1988-89, assesses filed its return of income on
3.8.1988. The return indicated `nil' income. In response to notices under
Section 143(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short `the Act'), the
assesses stated that it did not have a PE in India and, therefore, it was
not assessable to tax in India; that its Indian Operations consisting of
installation and commissioning of the platform commenced in the taxable
territory of India on 1.11.86 and got completed on 12.4.87 and, therefore,
the duration of the Project was less than nine months; that it was entitled
to exemption under Article 7 of the Convention for Avoidance of Double
Taxation (for short, `CADT'); that in the alternative it was liable to be
assessed on the basis of the accounts annexed to the returns; that the
accounts were based on the Completed Contract Method in its worldwide
accounts; that the accounts of its PE can be accepted in the Completed
Contract Method basis ; that it was maintaining income and expenditure
account of its PE in India; that the above contract was divisible into two
types of operations-one being fabrication in Korea and the other consisting
of installation in India and , therefore, any income arising from the
activity of fabrication in Korea was not assessable to tax in India and,
therefore, any income arising from the activity of fabrication in Korea was
not assessable to tax in India and to that extent the revenues receivable
under the above contract in respect of the activity of fabrication should
be excluded from the profit and loss account together with the expenditure
relating to the activity of fabrication. It was further contended that the
assesses had included the revenues relating to installation (Indian
Activity) in the profit and loss account and the expenditure relating to
that activity was debited on the Matching Principle Basis. It was further
contended that the profit and loss account consisted of two parts-the
Korean and the Indian part; that the Korean part recorded the entire
revenue/income received in Korea as also the expenditure incurred in Korea
relating to the Indian Project and debited to the Korean book of accounts.
All the above contentions were rejected by the A.O. it was held that the
duration of the Project consisting of installation and commissioning
extended beyond nine months, that the project constituted a PE of the
assessee in India in terms of Article 5(3) of CADT; that in any event the
office of HHI in Bombay constituted a PE under Article 5(2)(c), and
therefore, the claim of the assessee for exemption under Article 7 of the
CADT was not maintainable. Therefore, the profits attributable to the PE
were liable to be taxed in India in accordance with Article 7 of the CADT.
The A.O. also rejected the Completed Contract Method as well as the
accounts submitted by the assessee on the ground that the assessee had
failed to produce the relevant books of accounts in respect of the profit
and loss account; that they had refused to produce books of accounts
maintained in Korea; and that they had failed to produced the accounting
details pertaining to the activities/operations carried out by its PE in
India. For the said reasons the accounts were rejected by the A.O.
Therefore, the assessment was made for each of the two assessment years on
receipt basis. On the question of quantum of assessment, the A.O. held that
income from designing, fabrication, procurement of material etc. was partly
attributable to the PE of the assessee in India on the ground that
designing, fabrication and procurement of material were activities having
nexus/linkage to the ultimate activity of installation and commissioning of
platform in Bombay High and, therefore, income to that extent from the
Korean Operations was taxable in India. According to the A.O., the contract
was not divisible. According to the A.O., the contract was in respect of
the Turnkey Project; that the consideration in the contract was of lump sum
price; that even when the fabricated structure was delivered for
transportation to the representative of ONGC the accounts between the
parties remained to be settled; and since designing and fabrication of the
platform had an application in Bombay High, (where the platform was to be
come into operation), a part of the profits arising even from Korean
operations was taxable in India as such portion of the profits was
attributable to the work of installation and commissioning of the platform
in Bombay High. Accordingly the A.O. estimated the net profit of the
assessee under the contract at 20% of the gross receipts. Consequently, the
A.O. taxed the entire revenue relatable to the Indian Operations and he
taxed 2% of the contract revenue in respect of the Korean Operations.



9. Now, coming to the present case, the main argument advanced on behalf of
the Department was that the assessee was in receipt of consideration which
formed part of execution of Turnkey Project with ONGC; that there was one
integrated contract; that the contract was not divisible in terms of
separate activities and, therefore, the Tribunal had erred in holding that
profits accruing to the assessee from activities performed outside India
were not chargeable to tax in India. According to the Department, the work
of designing and fabrication under the Turnkey Project was totally
interlinked with installation and commissioning and, therefore, there was
no merit in the assessee's claim in respect of receipts attributable to the
activates performed outside India as not chargeable to tax in India.
According to the Department, the assessee was required to execute turnkey
work, that is, to supply certain equipments and install the same in India.
According to the Department, the supply of fabricated platform was
essentially linked to installation of the platform in the Bombay High.
Thus, according to the Department, there was a business connection and the
supplies were linked to the Project in Bombay High. For this reason,
according to the Department, the consideration received by the assessee for
supplies form outside India were taxable in India in terms of Section 9(1)
of the Act. On the other hand, the assessee placed reliance on Article 7 of
the CADT and submitted that on completion of the work of fabricated of
platforms the same were handed over to the Agents of the ONGC in Korea and,
therefore, the assessee was not liable to be taxed in respect of the
profits attributable to the operations of designing and fabrication in
Korea. In this connection, the assessee placed reliance on Article 7 of
CADT.



10. We quote hereinbelow Article 7 of CADT between Government of India and
Government of Korea which reads as under:

""ARTICLE 7 -Business profits-1. the profits of an enterprise of a
contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise
carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent
establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as
aforesaid the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but
only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.



5. For the purpose of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be
attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by he same
method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the
contrary.

6. Where income or profits include items of income which are dealt with
separately in other articles of this Convention, then the provisions of
those articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this article.""

11. On reading Article 7 of the CADT, it is clear that the said Article is
based on OECD Model Convention. Para (1) of Article 7 states the general
rule that business profits of an enterprise of one Contracting State may
not be taxed by the other Contracting State unless the enterprise carries
on its business in the Other Contracting State through its PE. The said
para 91) further lays down that only so much of the profits attributable to
the PE is taxable. Para 91) of Article 7 further lays down that the
attributable profit can be determined by the apportionment of the total
profits of the assessee to its various parts OR on the basis of an
assumption that the PE is a distinct and separate enterprise having its own
profits and distinct from GE. Applying the above test to the facts of the
present case, we find that profits earned by the Korean GE on supplies of
fabricated platforms cannot be made attributable to its Indian PE as the
installation PE came into existence only after the transaction stood
materialized. The installation PE came into existence only on conclusion of
the transaction giving rise to the supplies of the fabricated platforms.
The Installation PE emerged only after the contract with ONGC stood
concluded. It emerged only after the fabricated platform was delivered in
Korea to the Agents of ONGC. Therefore, the profits on such supplies of
fabricated platforms cannot be said to be attributable to the PE. There is
one more reason for coming to the aforestated conclusion. In terms of para
(1) of Article 7, the profits to be taxed in the source country were not
the real profits but hypothetical profits which the PE would have earned if
it was wholly independent of the GE. Therefore, even if we assume that the
supplies were necessary for the purposes of installation (activity of the
PE in India) and even if we assume that the supplies were an integral part,
still no part of profits on such supplies can be attributed to the
independent PE unless it is established by the Department that the supplies
were not at arm's length price. No such taxability can arise in the present
case as the sales were directly billed to the Indian Customer (ONGC). No
such taxability can also arise in the present case as there was no
allegation made by the Department that the price at which billing was done
for the supplies included any element for services rendered by the PE. In
the light of our above discussion, we are of the view that the profits that
accrued to the Korean GE for the Korean operations were not taxable in
India.",

At this stage, we may mention that the assessing officer in the assessment order had used the expression ""separate business"" in respect of the services rendered by the assessed to other airlines. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) the use of this expression was not apt, but (sic-by) further examining article 8 he held that para 3 of article 8 referred to certain activities which were preparatory or auxiliary to the main activity of transportation of passengers and cargo and these had also been exempted. He, therefore, held that the words ""separate business"" would mean such activities whose revenues were not exempt under article 8 from taxation in the source country. The Commissioner (Appeals) cited an example whereby an assessed operated aircraft in international traffic and also undertook number of other activities and there was a common management and financial set up in respect of all such activities. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) it could not be held that the whole of the profit of the enterprise would be exempt from tax in the source country under article 8 since only such profit would not be liable to be taxed under the said article as was derived from the activities mentioned therein and this would be true even when there was uniformity of control, management, finance and operations. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) there was nothing in article 8 which would lead to the conclusion that income derived from rendering services to other airlines was exempt from tax in the source country. In view of the aforesaid the Commissioner (Appeals) held that the income derived from rendering engineering services/ground handling services to aircraft of other airlines was not exempt vis-a-vis paras 1 and 3 of article 8 and the said revenues being a clear case of exploitation of excess activity through a permanent establishment the same were taxable in India. Dealing thereafter with the submissions of the assessed that its case was also covered under para 2 of the article i.e. participation in pools, the Commissioner (Appeals) referred to the Commentary on OECD Model by Klaus Vogel. The conclusions thereafter were as under :



(xiii) Similarly the concept of intention would not apply;

(xiv) The concept of ""same business"" had no relevance to the point at issue;

(xv) There were two kinds of profits-one defined in article 8 and the other in article 7 reliance was specifically placed on article 7(1), 7(2), 7(5) and 7(9);

(xvi) That vis-a-vis the aforesaid article it was the right of India to tax profits of the nature arising to the assessed;

(xvii) Article 8 (1) decided which state had a right to tax the profit/income, article 8(2) extended the scope of profit and article 8(3) extended the scope of the activity by including ""pools"" which generated profit;



(9) Exemption envisaged in article 8(1) was applicable to article 8(2) as well and there was no limit or ambiguity in article 8(2) as it mentioned pools of any kind and not necessarily profit earning pools;

(10) The revenue had considered that IATP was a pool and, therefore, article 8(1) applied to every kind of pool;

(11) In other treaties joint venture and pool were mentioned separately, but if both were to be considered as one and the same thing, then separate mention need not be there;

(12) Vis-a-vis article 9, sub-article (5) para 33 of the compilation pool was different then a joint venture;



61. We now come to article 8 itself with its separate clauses and on which have centered the arguments of both the parties.

62. Coming to article 8(1) there is no confusion or ambiguity since it exempts from the pale of taxation in a contracting state the profit earned by the enterprise of the other contracting state from the operation of aircraft in international traffic if the enterprise has effective management in the contracting state.

63. Article 8(2) in our opinion speaks of the same type of activity giving rise to profits earned by the enterprise participating in a pool for earning the profits derived from international traffic. In other words, what is done by an enterprise singly in article 1 is done by the same enterprise jointly with others by participating in a pool. We have in the earlier part of this order discussed at length the concept of ""Pools"" and nothing more is to be said so we move on to article 8(3).",
Article 8,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%208,,"27. I am also inclined to agree with sen and Chunder JJ. Vide  that Article 9 has obviously some reference to Section 178, Government of India Act where the same words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" occur, which reasonably suggests that Article 9, like the said Section 178, deals only with liabilities, connected with matters of revenue.

28. Indeed, it seems to me that the framers of Article 9 of the 1947 Order borrowed not only the phrase ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" from the corresponding Section 178, Government of India Act of 1935 which was then in force but also the broad scheme of that statute in the matter of the nature, scope and classification of contractual rights and liabilities of the State and a comparison of Ss. 177 and 178 of the Act of 1935 with Arts. 8 and 9 of the 1947 Order will show that, under both, State or Government contractual liabilities were grouped under two heads, namely, special contracts like loans, guarantees etc   and contracts in general.    The latter were dealt with in Section 177 and Article 8 and the former in the succeeding Section 178 and Article 9.   The opening words of Section 177(1), namely, ""without prejudice  to the  special provisions of the next succeeding section (Section 178) relating to loans, guarantees and other financial obligations,"" -- and  these words ""loans,   guarantees and other financial obligations"" which, in this Section 177, plainly refer to  certain special or excepted types of contractual liabilities obviously bear also the same sense in the succeeding Section 178, -- ""any contract etc."" and the opening words of Cl (6) of Article 8, namely, ""the provisions of this Article (Article 8)  shall have effect subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Order"", read in the light of the reference to ""any contract"" and ""all..... liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under 'the contract' or any such contract' "" in the earlier parts of the Article (Article 8), are sufficient to show that by the words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" were meant only contractual liabilities of some special type as distinguished from contractual liabilities in general, I do not think it is possible to contend, in view of the clear language of the two provisions (Section 177 and Article 8), that they purport to deal with any liability except contractual liability and, if that be so, the reservations, made in the quotations, set out above, must obviously refer to liabilities, arising out of certain transactions which are treated as special contracts at least for purposes of the above Act and Order.



45. The next point urged by the learned Assistant Government Pleader is that in view of the provisions of Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, the Province of East Bengal and not the Province of West Bengal is liable for the liability which was a liability of undivided Bengal before partition. The learned Subordinate Judge held in this connection that the liability of the Province of undivided Bengal to pay compensation for the requisitioned paddy amounted to a liability for actionable wrong and that therefore the liability had devolved upon the Province of West Bengal in view of Clause (2), Sub-clause (b) of Article 10, for the cause of action arose wholly within the territory of West Bengal, viz., in Midnapore District where the paddy was delivered after service of the requisition order. The learned Assistant Government Pleader has urged that Article 10 does not apply to the facts of the present case, because Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract, and since the paddy was requisitioned under the provisions of a statute, viz., Rule 75A of the Defence of India Rules, which had the same force as a section of the Defence of India Act. it cannot be said that there was any actionable wrong committed by the requisitioning and taking delivery of the paddy. The learned Assistant Government Pleader, therefore, urges that Article 7 will govern the case. But Article 7 clearly does not apply. It relates to property other than lands, goods, coins, bank notes, currency notes which immediately before the appointed day vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Governor-General in Council or of a province. Article 7 relates to division of assets, and it relates to property other than lands, goods, coins, etc. In the present case, we are concerned with goods viz., paddy itself, but with the liability to pay compensation for the paddy. Articles 8 to 10 deal with distribution of liability. Article 8 relates to contractual liability. Liability to pay compensation for requisitioned goods is not a contractual liability but is a statutory liability, and therefore Article 8 is ruled out. Requisitioning of paddy being a legal act in pursuance of a statute cannot be regarded as an actionable wrong, and therefore, we are thrown back on Article 9 which relates to liabilities in respect of such loans, guarantees and other financial obligations of the Governor-General in Council or of a province as are outstanding immediately before the appointed, day. If the liability to pay compensation for the requisitioned goods comes within the terms 'other financial obligations', clearly Article 9 would be applicable, and in that case, the liability would be that of the province of East Bengal. It has been held by this Court that the term 'other financial obligations' should be interpreted as ejus-dem generis with loans and guarantees, ""vide the cases  and  In the first case, viz.,  the liability was in respect of rent for a house which had been taken on hire by the Government for running a hospital. It was urged before their Lordships Harries C. J. and Sarkar J. that the dueg upto the date of partition were 'other financial obligations' coming within the terms of Article 9, Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, and therefore the Government of East Bengal would be liable. Their Lordships, however, held that the obligations to pay rent for the house arose out of a contract and it was therefore purely a contractual obligation covered by Article 8, and did not fall within 'other financial obligations' in Article 9. In delivering the judgment, Harries C. J. observed as follows:



59. The Indian Independence (Rights, property and Liabilities) Order was promulgated by the Governor-General of British India under powers conferred on him by Section 9 (1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 for making an initial distribution of the assets and liabilities of undivided India and undivided Provinces between the two Dominions and the new Provinces which came into existence under that Act. The liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal were distributed by Articles 8 (2), 9 (b) and 10 (2) of the Order. Article 8 in express terms deals with contractual liability; Article 9 read with Article 8 (6) leads to the conclusion that ""liabilities in respect of loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" of the Province of Bengal which were outstanding before the appointed day, are also a special class of contractual liabilities; and then Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an ""actionable wrong other than a breach of contract"". It is not disputed that the classification of liabilities made by Articles 8, 9 and 10 is exhaustive, so that whatever is not dealt with by Articles 8 & 9 comes under Article 10. In the case of  notice was served upon the Manager of the Tripura State under the Bengal Agri. Income-tax Act calling upon him to submit a return of agricultural income received by him during the previous year. The Ruler of the State then instituted a suit in June, 1946 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca for a declaration that the aforesaid Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income-tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void and for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the assessment. The suit was transferred from the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca to the Court of a Subordinate Judge, 24-Parganas. After partition of Bengal the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the place of Province of Bengal and it raised a plea that the Court of Alipur being situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The trial Court overruled the plea, but in revision this Court reversed the decision of the trial Court upon the view that Article 10 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947 applied to tortious acts (See the decision of this Court in Province of East Bengal v. State of Tripura, 53 Cal WN 368 at p. 380) (K). On appeal the Supreme Court held that the interpretation of the expression ""actionable wrong"" as given by this Court was too narrow. The judgment of the Supreme Court is .  Patanjali Sastri J. in delivering the majority judgment observed as follows;



65. The object of the learned Additional Government Pleader in seeking to establish that the liability of the Government in the present case is founded on contract, quasi-con tract or constructive contract is to take the case out of the operation of Article 10 and bring it under Article 9 (b). In order to attract the operation of Article 9 two things must be established: (1) that the liability is a contractual liability and (2) that the financial obligations of the nature of ""such loans and guarantees as are outstanding immediately before the appointed day"". If any of these elements be found wanting the case will fall outside Article 9. I have already held that the liability in the present case cannot be said to be a contractual liability in any sense.   Therefore the first element has hot been established.   But I am of the opinion that the second element is also absent.   The words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must, by the operation of Article 8  (6), be held to mean contractual obligation and if the provisions of Article 9 (b) are to be interpreted consistently with those of Article 8  (2)   (a)  that financial  obligation must be of a class other than what is contemplated by Article 8 (2) (a).   For this reason   it has been held in the cases of Nilima Sarkar v. Governor-General in Council, 86 Cal LJ 98 (P) (Harries C. J. and S. B. Sinha J.);  (Harries C. J. and Sarkar J.);   (Sen and Chunder JJ.) that the words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words ""loans and guarantees"" in the said article.   The decisions of this Court in the cases of Midnapur Zemindary Co. Ltd. (C) and Sree Sree Madan Gopal Jiu (D), have since been approved by the Supreme Court in the case of . In that case the question was whether the liability to pay rent under a lease was a ""financial obligation"" within   the   meaning   of Article   9   (b).   The Supreme Court pointed out that though an obligation to pay money under a contract or  breach thereof was a financial obligation in the popular sense, if Article 9 were to be construed so as not to ""rob Article 8 of practically the whole of its content"", that phrase as occurring in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis  with the words  ""loans  and guarantees"".   It was further held that the whole expression ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" must be interpreted in the technical sense in which it was used in Section 178, Government of India Act, 1935 and
  ""in that context financial obligation would mean obligations arising out of arrangements or agreements relating to State finance, such as distribution of revenue, the obligation to grant financial assistance by the Union to any State or the obligation of a State to make contributions and the like.""",

By The ... on 20 March, 1985",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1038852/?formInput=Article%208,,"(2) In Article 8, in Clause (b) for the letters and figures Rs. 50 ""occurring in two places, the letters and figures ""Rs. 250"" shall be substituted;

(3) after Article 8, as so amended, the following Article and entries shall be inserted, namely:

8A. For filing Balance-sheets audited and certified by Chartered Accountant.

(a) Where the chit amount does not exceed Rs. 500 - Rs. 10.00.

(b) When the chit amount exceeds Rs. 500 for the first Rs. 500 as under Sub-clause (a) and for every Rs. 500 or part thereof in excess of Rs. 500 subject to the maximum of Rs. 250. The fee leviable under this clause 'shall not exceed Rs. 250.



3. For the first time, for balance sheets audited by a Chartered Accountant a fee is imposed under Article 8-A. The rate of fee is the same fee which is charged when audited by chit auditors, having no nexus to the extent of service rendered by the Department. As for the increase made under Article 8, it is not challenged in these petitions. As Section 53 does not authorise imposition of fees for balance-sheets filed under Section 16 of the Act, and Section 63 alone having been invoked in carrying out the amendments, it is ultra vires of the Act. No service is rendered by the Registrar on receiving the balance-sheets and preserving them. The essential element of quid pro quo in the imposition of these fees is absent. So far as the Foremen are concerned, the Registrars do not render any special service in furtherance of his business and the fee collected has no correlation to the expenses incurred in rendering service, if any. The only ground relied upon in the impugned G.O. is that, to bring about rationalisation in rates, the fee for registration has been revised, taking into account the number of subscribers or the instalments whichever is higher, instead of the slab system which was prevailing prior to 21.10.1981. If whatever done by the Registrar at the time of registration are looked into the basis now adopted is highly irrational and unreasonable, and the imposition is disproportionate and not at all commensurate to the nature of service claimed to be rendered. Merely because in the neighbouring State of Kerala, a higher levy is imposed, the respondents have chosen to rely upon it so as to augment the general revenues of the State, and hence it is not a fee but a tax, which is not authorised under the Act.



27. As for Article 8-A in Appendix II relating to filing of balance-sheets audited and certified by Chartered Accountants are concerned, it is submitted by petitioners that there is a hostile discrimination and it acts as an unreasonable restriction on their trade and it is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 301 of the Constitution. Section 16(1) prescribes that every Foreman shall prepare and file with the Registrar a balance sheet duly audited either by auditors duly qualified to act as auditors of companies under the Companies Act, 1956 or by a chit auditor appointed under Section 51(2) of the Act and that it shall contain a summary of the assets and liabilities of the chit and furnish such other particulars as will disclose the nature of the assets and liabilities and how the value of the assets has been arrived at. Rule 26 states that a balance-sheet shall be prepared by the Foreman when the duration of the chit does not exceed one year on the termination of the chit and if it exceeds one year, then on the expiry of every period of 12 months and also on the termination of the chits, it should be filed within two months from the date of the said period. Form No. X catalogues the particulars to be furnished relating to (1) Receipts and Expenditure, (2) Statement of Assets and Liabilities, (3) Details of investments, (4) Assessment of value of investment, and (5) Profit and loss account. The Foreman has to, certify regarding the correctness and also the auditor has to certify stating that the balance-sheet is drawn up in conformity with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. An option is given to a Foreman either to file the balance-sheet audited by a Chartered Accountant or by a Chit Auditor. Under Section 51(2), a Chit Auditor is appointed by the Director of Chits. It is stated by the learned Additional Government Pleader that the Chit Auditors belong to the Department who are not qualified Chartered Accountants, but they are trained to scrutinise chit accounts. The fee charged when a Chit Auditor is approached is the same as charged when a balance-sheet certified by a Chartered Accountant is filed. It is strenuously pleaded by petitioners that when distinctly different services are contemplated as between them, the imposition of the same rate of levy of fees is hostile discrimination and an unreasonable restriction on 'the petitioners' trade. As to what requires to be done by a Chit Auditor call for consideration vis-a-vis what is done when a balance-sheet certified by Chartered Accountant --- is filed before the Registrar. Rule 28 deals with what requires to be done-when a Chit Auditor is approached for certifying balance-sheet and profit and loss account. If a Foreman desires to have the balance-sheet and profit and loss account audited by. a Chit Auditor, after the preparation of the balance-sheet, he must make an application under Rule 28 (1) to the Registrar for such audit to be done specifying whether it shall be at the premises of the Foreman or not and the application is to be accompanied by fees prescribed under Articles 8 of Appendix II. Thereafter, the Registrar will forward the application to the Inspecting Officer, who shall cause the balance-sheet and profit and loss account to be audited by the Chit Auditor, and in turn, he would send it to the Chit Auditor who shall thereupon require the Foreman to produce the chit records on such date, time and place as he may fix and it would then be the duty of the Foreman to produce ""all registers, books of accounts and other records relating to the chit accordingly and furnish such information and give such facilities as may be necessary or required for the proper audit of the balance-sheet and profit and loss account at the time and place fixed by the Chit Auditor"". A notice of not less than seven days shall be given to the Foreman as to the date of audit at the premi(sic) of the Foreman or for the production of registers, books of accounts and other records relating to the chit as the case may be. After scrutiny of all these documents, under Rule 29, the Chit Auditor will prepare his report and issue the certificate in quadruple and send one copy to the Foreman, the second to the Registrar and the third to the Inspecting Officer and keep the last copy for his own file. Rule 30(1) enjoins upon the Foreman to file with the Registrar a copy of the balance-sheet and profit and loss account together with the audit certificate and the auditor's report within one month from the date of the receipt from the Chit Auditor or within four months from the last date of the period covered by the balance-sheet whichever is earlier whereas, when a certificate is secured from a Chartered Accountant, Rule 30(2) directs the Foreman ""to file"" with the Registrar the documents which are referred to in Sub-rule (1) of Rule 30 within three months of the expiry of the period with reference to which, the balance-sheet is prepared under Rule 27.



This claim made is not in accord with what is found in Rule 30(2). Under the Rules only when a Chit Auditor prepares, a balance-sheet, registers, books of accounts and other records and other information have to be furnished under Rule 30(2), they are not required to be submitted. When a Chartered Accountant's certificate is filed, it cannot be said that in all those cases where such certificates are filed, once over the same work done by a Chit Auditor is carried out justifying the same rate of fee being charged. It may be that whenever any irregularities are found, it may call for a fresh clarification from the Foreman, but that would not mean that for all the chits without exception, the Registrar discharges, the same kind of services as done when a Chit Auditor is requisitioned. It must be pointed out that, when fee is collected under Article 8, it includes the services rendered by the Chit Auditor and also the services of scrutiny by the Registrar, who acts upon such certificate; whereas for the same fee paid when a Chit Auditor's certificate is filed, it results only in scrutiny by the Registrar and nothing more. Hence, to treat unlike situations as one and the same and impose same rate of fee, is arbitrary and illegal. When rules themselves do not comtemplate production of registers, books of accounts and other records, the claim made that pursuant to the filing of the balance-sheet, records have to be verified and that the whole matter has got to be thoroughly examined, is. unacceptable. In such of those matters where irregularities are noticed, the Registrar can call for all the records and scrutinise them and thereafter initiate prosecution or take such other action. Such instances would arise in both categories. Hence,
 when the rules themselves contemplate a different type of services to be rendered when Chartered, Accountant's certificates are filed, the fee imposable under Article 8-A cannot be the same as in Articles 8 which contemplates more comprehensive services to be rendered. Therefore, as rightly pleaded by the petitioners, the necessary element of quid pro quo is not existing., and furthermore this is an unreasonable restriction on right of trade and the rate fixed is aimed at increasing general revenues. It is of pointed interest to note that right from inception of the Act, such a fee was never contemplated, and that the Director of Chits drew inspiration from what is obtaining in Kerala and his proposals have been just accepted by the Government without any analysis made of what rates could be fixed on conditions prevailing governing the Act in force in Kerala and what nature of services are rendered by those authorities, are not spelt out. These conclusions 'arrived at are not to be understood that the State is disentitled from imposing any fee for filing of such balance-sheets under Article 8-A. A rate which would be commensurate to the nature of services extended by departmental personnel could be fixed, but what is now charged being identical to the fee imposed under Article 8, it is an illegal imposition.",

The agreement was to ensure for a minimum period of fifteen years.  

 4. It may be mentioned that in this reference we are concerned only with the 3% contribution provided in article 8 and not with the 2% running royalty inasmuch as the later payment has been allowed and there is no dispute about it.  



 5. Subsequently, the benefit of this agreement was taken over by the assessee-company which had assumed all the rights and obligation of J. B. Advani & Co. under the agreement with the Swiss Company.  

 6. For the two years in question the assessee-company paid to the Swiss company the amounts of Rs. 2,20,663 and Rs. 3,19,234 being the contribution at 3% under article 8. The claim of the assessee for deduction of the two amounts mentioned above for the two years was accepted by the Income-tax Officer. Subsequently, however, the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City I, considered that the action of the Income-tax Officer in allowing 3% research contribution as a deduction was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and took action under section 33B of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. After giving the necessary opportunity to the assessee, the Commissioner passed order under that section modifying the assessment in question so as to disallow the amounts claimed as deduction. The assessee, thereafter, carried the matter to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal contending that the amounts claimed as deduction should be allowed under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv) of the said Act or, in any event, under the residuary section 10(2)(xv) of the said Act. Reliance was placed on the specific terms of the agreement as well as on the correspondence between the assessee and the Swiss company. The Tribunal held that the assessee had not made out a case for allowance under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv) of the Act, but that the assessee would be eligible for allowance of the expenditure under section 10(2)(xv) of the Act. The Tribunal accordingly directed that the amounts disallowed under the orders or the Commissioner under section 33B should be allowed as deduction in the assessments in question.  



 8. In his order, the Commissioner considered the two amounts paid to the Swiss company in the two years in question as amounts paid for research contribution and concluded that they were not admissible as deduction. In his order, the Commissioner construed article 8 as providing that 2% is earmarked as running royalty for the rights conferred on the assessee and 3% is earmarked as a research fee or contribution. He read article 8 with article 6 and observed that research is directed towards improving the method of production of the electrodes and evolving improved formulae of recipes therefor. According to the Commissioner, the research expenses were incurred for the improvement of capital asset and, therefore, assumed the character of capital expenditure.  



 10. It is necessary to refer in detail to the correspondence which is made part of the statement of the case as annexure ""D"" (collectively). But a perusal thereof would seem to bear out the point urged by the assessee before the Tribunal. In fact, if the later part of article 8(a) is carefully scrutinised, it is clear that the research work which may be sought for by the licensee was ""in order to enable the licensee to the smooth running of his production and to meet the demands of the market"". It is obvious, therefore, that this was not a contribution for the general research work carried on by the Swiss company at its laboratories in Switzerland but in the nature of payment contemplated to be made in order to obtain assistance from the Swiss company for the solution or various problems and difficulties as would arise in the day-to-day working of the assessee-company and such solutions as were necessary for the smooth running of the assessee-company's factory and for meeting the demands of the market. The correspondence would also indicate that this is how the provisions in article 8(a) above set out were understood by the parties and acted upon. The Tribunal upheld the view of the Commissioner that the two amounts were not deductible under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv). According to the Tribunal, it was not possible to accept that 3% contribution was payable exclusively for general research, but it was a sort of composite payment as indicated in para. 8 of the order of the Tribunal. According to the Tribunal, this nature of the contribution rendered it ineligible for being considered as an allowable deduction under section 10(2)(xii) of the Act.",

Stuart Kings  the Commons  had to  wage a bitter struggle to

Rights, 1989  whereby it  was secured  ""that the  freedom of
speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to
be impeached  or questioned  in any  court or  place out  of
Parliament"" (Article 9). On May 2. 1695 the House of Commons
passed a  resolution whereby  it resolved that ""the offer of

tends to the subversion of the English constitution"". In the

128]. In  its  report  submitted  in  July  1976  the  Royal
Commission on  Standards of  Conduct in Public Life (chaired
by Lord	 Salmon) has pointed out that ""neither the statutory
nor the	 common law  applies to	 the  bribery  or  attempted

Lush J. also said :-
     ""I cannot	doubt that  it charges a
     conspiracy to  deceive the House of
     Lords,   and   so	 frustrate   the
     application,  by  means  of  making

The observations if Cockburn CJ., with whom Blackburn J. has
concurred, show	 that the  substance of the information laid
by Wason  was that  the alleged conspiracy was to make false
statements and	that such  statements were made in the House
of Lords  and that  the said  statements had  been made	 the
foundation  of	 the  criminal	proceeding.  Though  in	 the
judgment there	is no  reference to Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights but  the tenor of the abovequoted observations of the
learned Judges leave no doubt that the judgment was based on
that Article.  It has been so understood in later judgments.
[See : R.V. Caurrie & Ors.].



		       in
     We may  now examine whether the decision Ex parte Wason
has any	 bearing on  the interpretation	 of Article  105(2).
Clauses (1)  and (2)  of Article  105 are interlinked, while
clause (1)  secures to	the Members  freedom  of  speech  in
Parliament, clause  (@) safeguards  and	 protects  the	said
freedom by conferring immunity on the Members from liability
in respect  of anything	 said or  any vote  given by  him in
Parliament or  in any  committee thereof.  This is necessary
because for  a regulatory  body like Parliament, the freedom
of speech  is of  the utmost  importance and a full and free
debate is  on the  essence of  Parliamentary  democracy.  In
England this  freedom of  speech in Parliament is secured by
Article 9  of the  Bill of Rights. Though clause (2) Article
105 appears to be similar to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights
but a  closer look  would show	that they   certain aspects.
Article 9  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  by  prescribing	that
""freedom of  speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament
ought not  to be  impeached or	questioned in  any court  or
place out  of Parliament"",  confers immunity  in respect  of
speech,	 debates   or  proceedings   in	  Parliament   being
questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. The said
immunity has  been construed  to precluded  what was said or
done in	 Parliament in the course of proceedings there being
examined outside  Parliament for the purpose of supporting a
cause of  action even though the case of action itself arose
out of	something done	outside Parliament.  See : Church of
Scientology of	California v. Johnson Smith, 1972 (1) All ER
378]. In an Australian case R. v. Murphy, (1986) 5 NSWLR 18,
a question  arose whether  in the  course of criminal trial,
the witness's earlier evidence to the Select Committee could
be put	to him in cross-examination with a view to showing a
previous inconsistent  statement. Hunt	J.  in	the  Supreme
Court of New South Wales, held that Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights did  not prohibit  such cross-examination even if the
suggestion was	made that  the evidence	 given to the Select
Committee was  a lie. He further held that the statements of
the Select  Committee could  b e used to draw inferences and
could  be analysed and be made the basis of submission.



     [p. 415]
The protection	given under  clause (2)	 of Article  105  is
narrower than  that conferred under Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights in  the sense  that the	immunity conferred  by	that
clause in  personal in nature and is available to the member
in respect  of anything	 said or in any vote given by him in
the House or any committee thereof. The said clause does not
confer an  immunity for challenge in the court on the speech
or vote	 given by  a Member  of Parliament.  The  protection
given under  clause (2)	 of Article  105 is  thus similar to
protection envisaged  under the	 construction placed by Hunt
J. in  R v.,  Murphy [supra]  on Article 9 of	the Bill  of
Rights which  has not  been accepted by the Privy Council in
Prebble v.  Television New  Zealand Ltd.  The decision in Ex
parte Wason  (supra), which  was given	in  the	 context  of
Article 9  of the  Bill of  Rights, can,  therefore, have no
application in	the matter  of construction of clause (2) of
Article 105.  Ex parte	Wason (supra),	which holds that the
information laid  by Wason  did not  disclose any indictable
offence, proceeds  on the  basis  that	statements  made  by
members of either House of Parliament in their places in the
House, though they might be untrue to their knowledge, could
not be made the foundation of civil or criminal proceedings.
The position  under clause  (2) of  Article 105 is, however,
different. The	said clause does not prescribe that a speech
made or	 vote given by a member in Parliament cannot be made
the basis  of civil or criminal proceedings at all. The said
clause only  gives protection to the member who has made the
speech	or   has  given	 the  vote  from  liability  in	 any
proceeding in  a court	of law. Therefore, on the basis on t
he decision  in Ex  parte Wason	 (supra), it  cannot be said
that no	 offence was  committed by  those who are alleged to
have offered  the illegal gratification and by those who had
received  such	 gratification	to   vote  against   the  No
Confidence  Motion   and  for  that  reason  the  charge  of
conspiracy and	abetment must  also fall.  On the  basis  of
Article 105(2)	the claim  for immunity from prosecution can
be made	 only on  behalf of  A-3 to A-5 and A-16 to A-21 who
are alleged  to have voted against the No Confidence Motion.
As to  whether they  are entitled  to  such  immunity  under
Article 105(2)	will, however,	depend on the interpretation
of the provisions of Article 105(2).",
Article 9,"A.P. Moller, Maersk Agency India Pvt. ... vs Dcit, Special Range 31 on 27 January, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1674452/?formInput=Article%209,,"3. Apropos the ancillary charges, assessee did not dispute the addition before the CIT(A). For the first time issue was raised before us. It was stated to be a legal issue. After hearing learned departmental representative, we permit the assessee to raise this issue before the Tribunal.

4. We have heard the rival submissions in the light of material placed before us and precedents relied upon. Shri F.V. Irani, learned counsel for the assessee, appeared before us. Our attention was invited on Article 9 of the Convention Between Republic of India and the Kingdom of Denmark for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital. Article 9 reads as under:



""ARTICLE 9: Shipping - 1. Profits derived from the operation of ships in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting State from which they are derived provided that the tax so charged shall not exceed:

(a) during the first five fiscal years after the entry into force of this Convention, 50 per cent, and
 




(b) profits from the operation of ships includes profits derived from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) in connection with the transport of goods or merchandise in international traffic.""   

Learned counsel for the assessee contended that the slot fee and ancillary charges cannot be construed to be income derived from the operation of ships. As such, these cannot be taxed under Article 9(2). It was stated that the several heads of income mentioned in the I.T. Act are mutually exclusive. A particular income can come only under one of them. If the income can be brought under one head, it cannot be brought under residuary head if the heads of income are mutually exclusive. The heads of income must be decided on the nature of income by applying the practical common notions and not by reference to the assessee's treatment of income. As such, if the income is not coming within the ambit of Article 9, it cannot be taxed. For this proposition, reliance was placed on the decision rendered in the case of CIT v. T.P. Sidhwa(133 ITR 840) and Nalinikant Ambalal Modi v. CIT (61 ITR 428)(SC).



10. Section 90, Sub-section(2) of the Act reads as under:
 ""(2) Where the Central Government has entered into an agreement with the Government of any country outside India under Sub-section (1) for granting relief of tax, or as the case may be, avoidance of double taxation, then, in relation to the assessee to whom such agreement applies, the provisions of this Act shall apply to the extent they are more beneficial to that assessee."" 

11. The prescription of Section 90(2) can be invoked only if DTAA applies to the income in dispute. Article 9 says about profit derived from the operation of ships. Learned counsel for the assessee admitted that slot charges and ancillary charges are not corning within the ambit of the income from operation of ships. We find that the term 'derived' is used in Article 9. The dictionaries state that the word 'derived' is usually followed by the word 'from', and it means: get or trace from a source; arise from, originate in, so the origin or formation of. As a matter of plain English, when it is said that one word is derived from another, often in another language, what is meant is that the source of that word is another word, often in another language. As an illustration, the word 'democracy' is derived from the Greek word 'demos', the people, and most dictionaries will so state. That is the ordinary meaning of the words ""derived from"" and there is no reason to depart from that ordinary meaning here. As such, slot charges and ancillary charges cannot be construed to be income derived from the operation of ships. Article 9 is the only Article in the DTAA dealing with the shipping business. It restricted the applicability of Article only to that income which is derived from the operation of ship. The other incomes of shipping companies are not coming within the ambit of Article 9. Article 7 cannot be applied in the facts of the present case as it is not connected with the shipping business, for which a separate Article is there. Even income derived from operation of ships is to be charged to tax in India in accordance with the provision of Article 9(2) of the DTAA. To construe the meaning of the words ""such profits"" as used in Article 9(2), learned counsel argued that such profits means profits from operation of ships. Slot charges and ancillary charges are not the profits from the operation of ships. As such, these cannot be taxed under Article 9(2). In the same breath, he says that as there is no provision in the DTAA for taxing such profits, therefore, no tax should be charged on such profits. For that, he relied on T.P. Sidhwa's case and Nalinimkant Modi's case. These decisions are not pertinent to the issue. If a special provision is made on a certain matter, the matter is excluded from the general provision. This idea is inculcated in the dictum: GENERALIBUS SPECIALLA DEROGANT (special things derogate from general things). When DTAA deals with shipping business under Article 9, no other Article can be invoked in the context of shipping business. It is therefore clear that DTAA is silent over taxing the profits of shipping company derived otherwise than from the operation of ships. In such eventuality, the profits can be taxed in India as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.",

circumstances of the case, the disallowance under section 40(a)(i) of the
Act is correct in law. His arguments are summarized as under:
     (a) that provisions of article 9(1) of DTAA apply to the facts of this
        case, which is one of the exceptions mentioned in article 24(3)
        of the DTAA, thus, the assessee cannot invoke article 24(3) of
        the DTAA between Indian & Japan.
     (b) that in the case of Herbalife International India private limited
        (supra) the Hon'ble High Court at para-34 has recorded that it is
        not the case of the Revenue that article 9(1) or article 11(7)
        applies in that case and hence the case is distinguishable


                                                     & 5483/Del/2014







(c) that regarding the contention of the assessee the TPO has
  found all the transaction to be at arm's length and hence the
  conditions laid down in article 9(1) are not satisfied, the Ld. DR
  submitted that the TPO's order was constrained by the
  disclosure made before him by the assessee and TPO's order
  did not capture more than 40 elements, which constituted 'the
  condition in terms of Article 9(1) 'from the FAR analysis
  presented before him. The AO vividly captured these 40
  elements which is brought on record due to 2 surveys carried
  out by the AO and ITO (TDS), respectively. Otherwise, the
  applicability of article 9 would depend on whether any
  adjustment to ALP is made, even though the transaction are
  made every year with the same AEs, which would not be a
  rational interpretation.



 (h) that the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Herbalife
        (supra) relied upon by the assessee does not deal with the
        provision of section 40(a)(i) as amended by Finance Act (No.2)
        2004, w.e.f., 01/04/2005.

10.   In rejoinder, the Ld. counsel of the assessee submitted that all the
contention raised by the Ld. CIT(DR) had already been considered by
the coordinate bench in the assessee's own case for assessment year
2009-10. The learned counsel also submitted that the arguments taken
up by the Revenue on the applicability of article 9 of the DTAA and
hence the exclusion of article 24(3) has no merits since the TPO are
consistently found that the transaction between the assessee and all the
non-resident companies were at arm's length. He submitted that a plain
reading of article 9 of the DTAA reveals that what is required under the
said article is that the transaction between the associated enterprises
should be conducted on arm's length basis and uninfluenced by the
close relationship. He submitted that said test has been met in the
present case when the TPO has found all the transaction between the
assessee and its AEs on arm's length basis. Thus, he submitted that the
effort of the Revenue to distinguish the jurisdictional High Court in the
case of Herbalife (supra), was without any merit.



   These findings are binding on us. Thus, we have to uphold the
   arguments of the ld. counsel for the assessee and reverse the
   findings of the AO as confirmed by the ld.CIT(A).

18. Coming to the argument of the ld. DR that the conditions stated
in Article 24(3) are not satisfied, as provisions of Article 9(1) applies,
as the transactions are between AEs and the profits which would,
but for those conditions would have accrued to one of the
enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued,
we find that the Transfer Pricing Officer in all these cases has come
to the conclusion that the transactions between the Associated
Enterprises are at arm's length price. The ld. DR made strenuous
and elaborate submissions bringing out certain issues raised by the
AO, to persuade us that TPO was wrong in coming to the conclusion
that the transactions between the AEs and the assessee are at
arm's length. We find that the TPO has passed the order after the
surveys were conducted on the assessee. If the AO had certain
additional material facts, he could have brought it to the notice of the
TPO and asked for a fresh report. In our view, this argument of the
Ld. D.R. is erroneous, as the revenue wants to take a stand that the
transactions between the assessee and its AE are not at arm's
length for the limited purpose of denying the benefit of the non-
discrimination article in the DTAA to the assessee and not for
making any additions under the transfer pricing provisions. Year
after year, the transfer pricing officer has given a finding that the
transactions between the assessee and the AE are at arm's length.
The ld. DR, without specifically pointing out as to what is the
difference between the arm's length price and the price at which the
transactions have taken place between the assessee and the AE
and without quantifying the excess/shortage in the price, seeks to
invoke Article 9(1). In our view, such an argument is devoid of merit
and hence we dismiss the same.",
Article 9,"T.A. Mahomed Usman vs State Of Madras Represented By Secy. To ... on 17 November, 1959",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1506246/?formInput=Article%209,,"The other articles which are of immediate relevance to the cases before us are Articles 9, 10 and 11.

 ""Article 9: No person shall be a citizen of India
by virtue of article 5, or be deemed to be a citizen
of India by virtue of article 6 or article 8, if he has
voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign
State.   

 Article 10: Every person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India under any of the foregoing provisions of this Part shall, subject to the provisions of any law that may be made by Parliament, continue to be such citizen.  



  By virtue of Article 9 a person would not be deemed to be citizen of India by birth or by reason of relationship, if he had voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign state. But obviously Article 9 has application to the acquisition of citizenship of a foreign State before the commencement of the Constitution, and is in the nature of a proviso or rider to the other articles, under which a person is treated as a citizen of India. The expression ""foreign State"" is defined in Article 367 as meaning any State other than India. This is however subject to the proviso 'provided that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the President may by order declare any State not to be a foreign state for such purposes as may be specified in the order'. 



 19. It would thus be seen that though Pakistan might not have been a foreign country within the meaning of Article 9 of the Constitution because oft the Governor-General's order promulgated under Article 367(3), the acquisition of Pakistani citizenship would terminate the Indian citizenship of a person under the Citizenship Act, 1955, and this position was not contested.  

 20. The arguments of learned counsel ranged over a very wide field, but before entering into a discussion on the points urged, it might be convenient to set out two matters--merely to put them aside. The first relates to a contention, that the rules contained in Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 infringed 'the freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India' and 'to move freely throughout the territory of India' guaranteed by Articles 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e) of the Constitution.  



 At the same time, recognising that several persons who would be Indian citizens under Article 5 had migrated to Pakistan, at the time of the Partition, it makes provision in Article 7 for such persons not being Indian citizens, and finally Article 9 recognises the right of Indian citizens to voluntarily ex-patriate themselves. It is clear that the principle of jus soli and jus sanguinis enunciated by Article 5, must give rise to the problem of dual nationality, and by Article 11 Parliament is expressly vested with power to make laws providing inter alia for terminat-ing Indian Citizenship.",
Article 9,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%209,,"27. I am also inclined to agree with sen and Chunder JJ. Vide  that Article 9 has obviously some reference to Section 178, Government of India Act where the same words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" occur, which reasonably suggests that Article 9, like the said Section 178, deals only with liabilities, connected with matters of revenue.

28. Indeed, it seems to me that the framers of Article 9 of the 1947 Order borrowed not only the phrase ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" from the corresponding Section 178, Government of India Act of 1935 which was then in force but also the broad scheme of that statute in the matter of the nature, scope and classification of contractual rights and liabilities of the State and a comparison of Ss. 177 and 178 of the Act of 1935 with Arts. 8 and 9 of the 1947 Order will show that, under both, State or Government contractual liabilities were grouped under two heads, namely, special contracts like loans, guarantees etc   and contracts in general.    The latter were dealt with in Section 177 and Article 8 and the former in the succeeding Section 178 and Article 9.   The opening words of Section 177(1), namely, ""without prejudice  to the  special provisions of the next succeeding section (Section 178) relating to loans, guarantees and other financial obligations,"" -- and  these words ""loans,   guarantees and other financial obligations"" which, in this Section 177, plainly refer to  certain special or excepted types of contractual liabilities obviously bear also the same sense in the succeeding Section 178, -- ""any contract etc."" and the opening words of Cl (6) of Article 8, namely, ""the provisions of this Article (Article 8)  shall have effect subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Order"", read in the light of the reference to ""any contract"" and ""all..... liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under 'the contract' or any such contract' "" in the earlier parts of the Article (Article 8), are sufficient to show that by the words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" were meant only contractual liabilities of some special type as distinguished from contractual liabilities in general, I do not think it is possible to contend, in view of the clear language of the two provisions (Section 177 and Article 8), that they purport to deal with any liability except contractual liability and, if that be so, the reservations, made in the quotations, set out above, must obviously refer to liabilities, arising out of certain transactions which are treated as special contracts at least for purposes of the above Act and Order.



 ""The obligation to pay rent is in one sense a financial obligation, but I think it is clear that the words 'and   other financial   obligations   of a province' in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words 'loans and guarantees.....

Clearly it was not intended to cover purely contractual obligations; otherwise, Article 8 becomes wholly Worthless."" 

In , their Lordships were concerned with the claim for compensation for land acquired in the district of Burd-wan before the appointed day; a suit had been filed also before the appointed day and their Lordships held that the suit for compensation for land acquired must be regarded as a suit for the land which under Article 5 had devolved on the province of West Bengal and under Article 12, the province of West Bengal must be substituted for the Province of Bengal. In repelling the argument advanced on behalf of the West Bengal Government that the claim could be covered by Article 9. Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, their Lordships (Sen and Chunder JJ.) repeated the observations of Harries C. J., in the earlier case, viz., that the words 'other financial obligations' must be interpreted as ejusdem generis with loans and guarantees. Their Lordships grave the reason that Article 9 has reference to Article 178, Government of India Act, 1935, where the same words 'loans and guarantees and other financial obligations' are also used, and that it would appear from the Government of India Act that the obligations considered in that connection were obligations charged upon the revenue of the State and therefore in Article 9 of the Bights, Property and Liabilities order also the words 'other financial obligations' must mean obligations of the same nature as loans and guarantees charged on the revenue of the State, It may however be pointed out that in Section 178, Government of India Act, the words 'other financial obligations'  are   expressly defined   as  obligations secured on the revenues.   Clause (1)  of Section 178 deals with ""all liabilities in respect of such loans guarantees and other obligations of the Secretary of State in Council as are outstanding immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act, and were secured on the revenues of India"". Clause (4) of the same section deals with ""any loans or other financial obligations secured upon the revenues of province"" in respect of liability of any local Government in India.   In Article 9 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, the words 'other financial obligations' are not expressly qualified as to mean obligations which are charged on the revenues of the State, and even accepting   that   the   expression   ""other   financial obligations"" is to be interpreted ejusdem generis with  loans and guarantees, the  point has to be borne in mind in deciding what can be included within that expression.



48. In a case decided and reported after we had heard the arguments in the present cape, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the expression 'other financial obligations' as used in Article 9; vide . In that case, the liability to pay rent under a lease was the liability under consideration; it was held that it did not come within Article 9 but would come within Article 8. The Supreme Court observed that if the expression other financial obligations' were interpreted ejus-dem generis with the expressions loans' and 'guarantees' there could be no difficulty in drawing the line between matters that would fall within Article 8 and those that would fall within Article 9. The Supreme Court referred in this connection to the two Calcutta cases already referred to. But the Supreme Court did not finally decide what obligations would be included in the expression 'other financial obligations;' and observed that in each case the question whether a particular obligation fell within the, expression 'financial obligations' within the meaning of Article 9 would have to be considered.



65. The object of the learned Additional Government Pleader in seeking to establish that the liability of the Government in the present case is founded on contract, quasi-con tract or constructive contract is to take the case out of the operation of Article 10 and bring it under Article 9 (b). In order to attract the operation of Article 9 two things must be established: (1) that the liability is a contractual liability and (2) that the financial obligations of the nature of ""such loans and guarantees as are outstanding immediately before the appointed day"". If any of these elements be found wanting the case will fall outside Article 9. I have already held that the liability in the present case cannot be said to be a contractual liability in any sense.   Therefore the first element has hot been established.   But I am of the opinion that the second element is also absent.   The words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must, by the operation of Article 8  (6), be held to mean contractual obligation and if the provisions of Article 9 (b) are to be interpreted consistently with those of Article 8  (2)   (a)  that financial  obligation must be of a class other than what is contemplated by Article 8 (2) (a).   For this reason   it has been held in the cases of Nilima Sarkar v. Governor-General in Council, 86 Cal LJ 98 (P) (Harries C. J. and S. B. Sinha J.);  (Harries C. J. and Sarkar J.);   (Sen and Chunder JJ.) that the words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words ""loans and guarantees"" in the said article.   The decisions of this Court in the cases of Midnapur Zemindary Co. Ltd. (C) and Sree Sree Madan Gopal Jiu (D), have since been approved by the Supreme Court in the case of . In that case the question was whether the liability to pay rent under a lease was a ""financial obligation"" within   the   meaning   of Article 9   (b).   The Supreme Court pointed out that though an obligation to pay money under a contract or  breach thereof was a financial obligation in the popular sense, if Article 9 were to be construed so as not to ""rob Article 8 of practically the whole of its content"", that phrase as occurring in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis  with the words  ""loans  and guarantees"".   It was further held that the whole expression ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" must be interpreted in the technical sense in which it was used in Section 178, Government of India Act, 1935 and
  ""in that context financial obligation would mean obligations arising out of arrangements or agreements relating to State finance, such as distribution of revenue, the obligation to grant financial assistance by the Union to any State or the obligation of a State to make contributions and the like.""",
Article 9,"Mitsubishi Corporation India Pvt. ... vs Dcit, Circle- 16(2), New Delhi on 22 September, 2017",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/122427784/?formInput=Article%209,,"3. Except where the provisions of article 9, paragraph 8 of article
11, or paragraph 7 of article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other
disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a
resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of
determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible
under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of
the first mentioned Contracting State.........'.

17     It is equally important to consider the prescription of
Article 9, the relevant part of which runs as under :-



                               16                   ITA No5184/Del/2017




18.     The case of the ld. AR is that the assessee is entitled to the
benefit of Article 24 in terms of para 3. A perusal of this para
transpires that except where the provisions of Article 9 etc. apply,
interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an Indian
enterprise to a Japanese enterprise, shall, be deductible in
determining the taxable profits of the Indian enterprise under the
same conditions as if they had been paid to an Indian resident.
Simply stated, para 3 of Article 24 provides that any payment
made by an Indian enterprise to a Japanese enterprise shall, for
the purposes of determining the taxable profit of an Indian
enterprise, be taken up under the same conditions as if the
payment had been made to an Indian resident and not to a non-
resident. In simple words, for the purpose of computing the
taxable profit of an Indian enterprise, the provisions of the Act
shall apply on a transaction with a Japanese enterprise as if it is a
transaction with an Indian enterprise. If the transaction with a
Japanese enterprise entails some adverse consequences in
comparison with if such transaction had been made with an
Indian enterprise, then such adverse consequences will be
remedied under this clause by presuming, for computing the total
income of an Indian enterprise, as if it was a transaction with an
Indian enterprise and not a Japanese enterprise. Thus, Article 24
provides in unequivocal terms that for the purposes of
determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, any
disbursements made to a Japanese enterprise shall be deductible
in the same manner as if it had been made to an Indian resident.
When we examine the TDS provisions, it is noticed that no
provision under the Chapter XVII of the Act stipulates for
deduction of tax at source from payment made for the purchases
made from an Indian resident. This position when contrasted
with purchases made from a non-resident, imposes liability on the
purchaser for deducting tax at source under section 195, subject
to the fulfilment of other conditions. When we compare an Indian
enterprise purchasing goods from an Indian party vis-a-vis from a
Japanese party, there is possibility of an obvious discrimination
in terms of disallowance of purchase consideration under section
40(a)(i) in so far as the purchases from a Japanese enterprise are
concerned. It is this discrimination which is sought to be
remedied by para 3 of Article 24. The effect of this Article is that
in determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, the
provisions of the Act, including disallowance u/s 40(a)(i), shall
apply as if the purchases made from a Japanese enterprise are
made from an Indian enterprise. Once purchases are construed to
have been made by an Indian enterprise from another Indian
enterprise, not requiring any deduction of tax at source from the
                              17                   ITA No5184/Del/2017


purchase consideration and consequently ousting the application
of section 40(a)(i), the non-discrimination clause shall operate to
stop the making of disallowance in case of purchases actually
made from a Japanese enterprise, which would have otherwise
attracted the disallowance. Thus, it is evident that para 3 of
Article 24, without considering the effect of Article 9 and other
Articles referred to in the beginning of this para, rules out the
making of disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.



19.     Now let us examine Article 9 of the DTAA and its setting
in Article 24(3), which in the opinion of the ld. DR, comes to the
rescue of the Revenue in making inoperative the otherwise
applicability of para 3 of Article 24. The opening part of para 3
provides that `Except where the provisions of article 9 .... apply'.
Then it talks about the application of non-discrimination as
discussed above. This shows that the provisions of Article 24(3)
shall be restricted to the extent of applicability of Article 9. In
other words, whatever has been provided in Article 9 shall remain
intact and will have superseding effect over the mandate of
Article 24(3). The contention of the ld. DR that once Article 9
applies, then the application of Article 24(3) is thrown out, is not
wholly correct. The writ of Article 9 does not stop the
application of Article 24(3) in entirety. The overriding effect of
Article 9 over para 3 of Article 24 is limited to its content alone.
In other words, the mandate of Article 24 applies save and except
as provided in Article 9 etc. It does not render Article 24(3)
redundant in totality. A conjoint reading of these two Articles
brings out that if there is some discrimination in computing the
taxable income as regards the substance of Article 9, then such
discrimination will continue as such. But, in so far as rest of the
discriminations covered under para 3 of Article 24 are concerned,
those will be removed to the extent as provided.



20.     Now let us decipher the instruction of the relevant part of
Article 9 of the DTAA as extracted above. Para 1 of this Article
can be viewed in two parts, viz., clause (a) or clause (b) as one
part and the portion starting with `and' as the second part. Such
first part sets out the basic condition for the applicability of the
second part. The first part provides for the one enterprise directly
or indirectly controlling or contributing to the capital of the other
or the existence of common persons managing or contributing to
the capital of both the enterprises. The existence of the conditions
set out in the first part in the case of the assessee has not been
disputed by the ld. AR. The second part of para 1 of Article 9
provides that when the stipulations of the first part of para 1 of
Article 9 are satisfied AND the conditions between the two
                              18                  ITA No5184/Del/2017


enterprises in their commercial or financial relations differ from
those which would have been between two independent
enterprises, then, any profit which has not accrued to one of the
enterprises due to such conditions, may be included in the profits
of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. The effect of the second
part is that the transactions between the two enterprises should be
viewed at arm's length notwithstanding their commercial or
financial relations. And if the profit accruing to an enterprise has
been understated due to such commercial or financial relations,
then, such understated profits should also be taxed. On
circumspection of Article 9 read with Article 24, the position
which emerges is that the enhancement of income made by virtue
of Article 9 in treating the inhibited transactions between two
enterprises as at arm's length price, cannot be neutralised by the
application of Article 24. In other words, Article 24 applies on all
discriminations as set out in it except those specifically excluded
including Article 9. Reverting to the facts of the instant case, we
find that the assessee is seeking the benefit of article 24 qua the
disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) and not in respect of any transfer
pricing adjustment made by bringing transactions between two
AEs at arm's length price. Disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is an
independent component of the computation of total income which
is distinct from any transfer pricing adjustment. Article 24 read
with Article 9 albeit prohibits the deletion of enhancement of
income due to the making of transactions at ALP, but permits the
deletion of enhancement of income due to disallowance u/s
40(a)(i) of the Act. Be that as it may, we find that the TPO has
not proposed any transfer pricing adjustment in respect of
`Trading segment' of the assessee under which the purchases in
question were made. The addition on account of TP adjustment
is in respect of `Service fee received', which was earned by the
assessee without making purchases of the goods from its AEs.
As disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is in respect of purchases made from
the AEs, which is in no manner connected with the Commission
segment, we hold that the assessee is entitled to the benefit
provided by article 24 of the DTAA and cannot be visited with
the disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.",
Article 9,"Eco Maritime Ventures Ltd vs Ing Bank Nv on 27 June, 2016",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/54155741/?formInput=Article%209,,"12. Now let us interpret Articles 3(1) and (4) of

          O/OJCA/234/2016                                             ORDER



         the   critical   link   between   the   person   liable   and  
         the   vessel   on   both   the   occasions,   i.e.   at   the  
         time   of   accrual   of   cause   of   action   and   at   the  
         time   of   arrest.   The   question   is   whether   the  
         requirement,   therefore,   that   the   owner   must   be  
         the person liable (save when the claim is secured  
         by   a  maritime   lien)   is   implied   by   Article   3(1).  
         That it is so implied  is clear from the reading  
         of   Article   3   as   a   whole,   firstly,   because  
         otherwise   there   is   no   reason   why   a   ship   other  
         than that in respect of which the maritime claim  
         has arisen can be arrested  on the basis  that it  
         is   owned   by   the   owner   of   the   particular   ship  
         (i.e. that ship in respect of which the maritime  
         claim has arisen). Secondly, the opening words of  
         Article   3(1),   ""subject   to   the   provisions   of  
         paragraph 4"", also make it clear that paragraph 4  
         constitutes an exception to the general rule laid  
         down in paragraph 1. Since the exception consists  
         in   the   right   of   arrest   of   a   ship   when   the 
         charterer   by   demise   and   not   the   owner   is   liable  
         in   respect   of   the   maritime   claim,   in   all   other  
         cases   the   general   rule   must   apply,   namely,   that  
         the arrest is only permissible when the owner of  
         the   ship   is   liable.   This   implication   is   also  
         clear   when   we   read   Article   9   of   the   1952  
         Convention   in   conjunction   with   Article   3(1). 
         Article 9 is in the following words:



            This   Article   makes   it   clear   that   by   Article  
            3(1)   no   new   right   of   action   or   maritime   lien

9. The proceedings of the Constituent Assembly on draft Article (10) disclose a persistent and strident demand from certain sections of the society for providing reservations in their favour in the matter of public employment. While speaking on the draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] Dr. Ambedkar had stated, ""then we have quite a massive opinion which insists that although theoretically it is good to have the principle that there shall be equality of opportunity, there must at the same time be a provision made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration."" It was this demand which was mainly responsible for the incorporation of Clause (4) in Article 16. As matter of fact, in some of the southern States, reservations in favour of O.B.Cs. were in vogue since quite a number of years prior to the Constitution. There was a demand for similar reservations at the center. In response to this demand and also in realisation of its obligation to provide for such reservations in favour of backward sections of the society, the Central Government appointed a Backward Class Commission under Article 340 of the Constitution on January 29, 1953. The Commission, popularly known as Kaka Kalelkar Commission, was required ""to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes within the territory of India and the difficulties under which they labour and to make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by the Union or any State to remove difficulties and to improve their conditions"". The Commission submitted its report on March 30, 1955. According to it, the relevant factors to consider while classifying backward classes would be their traditional occupation and profession, the percentage of literacy or the general educational advancement made by them; the estimated population of the community and the distribution of the various communities throughout the state or their concentration in certain areas. The Commission was also of the opinion that the social position which a community occupies in the caste hierarchy would also have to be considered as well as its representation in Government service or in the Industrial sphere. According to the Commission, the causes of educational backwardness amongst the educationally and backward communities were (i) traditional apathy for education on account of social and environmental conditions or occupational handicaps: (ii) poverty and lack of educational institutions in rural areas and (iii) living in inaccessible areas. The Chairman of the commission, Kaka Kalelkar, however, had second thoughts after signing the report. In the enclosing letter addressed to the President he virtually pleaded for the rejection of the report on the ground that the reservations and other remedies recommended on the basis of caste would not be in the interest of society and country. He opined that the principle of caste should be eschewed altogether. Then alone, he said, would it be possible to help the extremely poor and deserving members of all the communities. At the same time, he added, preference ought to be given to those who come from traditionally neglected social classes.



PART - II
 
 

Before we proceed to answer the questions aforementioned, it would be helpful to notice (a) the debates in the Constituent Assembly on Article 16 (draft Article 10); (b) the decisions of this Court on Articles 16 and 15; and (c) a few decisions of the U.S.Supreme Court considering the validity of race-conscious programmes.

The Framing of Article 16: Debates in the Constituent Assembly
  25. Draft Article 10 corresponds to Article 16. The debate in the Constituent Assembly on draft Article 10 and particularly Clause (3), thereof [corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16] helps us to appreciate the background and understand the objective underlying Article 16, and in particular, Clause (4) thereof. The original intent comes out clear and loud from these debates. 



Ultimately Dr. B.R.Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, got up to clarify the matter. His speech, which put an end to all discussion and led to adopting of draft Article 10(3), is worth quoting in extenso, since it throws light on several questions relevant herein:

...there are three points of view which it is necessary for us to reconcile if we are to produce a workable proposition which will be accepted by all. Of the three points of view, the first is that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens. It is the desire of many Members of this House that every individual who is qualified for a particular post should be free to apply for that post, to sit for examinations and to have his qualifications tested so as to determine whether he is fit for the post or not and that there ought to be no limitations, there ought to be no hindrance in the operation of this principle of equality or opportunity. Another view mostly shared by a section of the House is that, if this principle is to be operative-and it ought to be operative in their judgment to its fullest extent-there ought to be no reservations of any sort for any class or community at all, that all citizens, if they are qualified, should be placed on the same footing of equality so far as the public services are concerned. That is the second point of view we have. Then we have quite a massive opinion which insists that, although theoretically it is good to have the principle that there shall be equality of opportunity, there must at the same time be a provision made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration. As I said, the Drafting Committee had to produce a formula which would reconcile these three points of view, firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly that there shall be reservations in favour of certain communities which have not so far had a 'proper look-in' so to say into the administration. If honourable Members will bear these facts in mind-the-three principles we had to reconcile,-they will see that no better formula could be produced than the one that is embodies in Sub-clause (3) of Article 10 of the Constitution. It is a generic principle. At the same time, as I said, we had to reconcile this formula with the demand made by certain communities that the administration which has now-for historical reasons-been controlled by one community or a few communites, that situation should disappear and that the others also must have an opportunity of getting into the public services. Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in full the demand of those communities who have not been so far employed in the public service to the fullest extent, what would really happen is, we shall be completely destroying the first proposition upon which we are all agreed, namely, that there shall be an equality of opportunity. Let me give an illustration. Supposing, for instance, reservations were made for a community or a collection of communities, the total of which came to something like 70 per cent of the total posts under the State and only 30 per cent are retained as the unreserved. Could anybody say that the reservation of 30 per cent as open to general competition would be satisfactory from the point of view of giving effect to the first principle, namely, that there shall be equality of opportunity? It cannot be in my judgment. Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the reservation is to be consistent with Sub-clause (1) of Article 10, must be confined to a minority of seats. It is then only that the first principle could find its place in the Constitution and effective in operation. If honourable Members understand this position that we have to safeguard two things, namely, the principle of equality of opportunity and at the same time satisfy the demand of communities which have not had so far representation in the State, then, I am sure they will agree that unless you use some such qualifying phrase as ""backward"" the exception made in favour of reservation will ultimately eat up the rule altogether. Nothing of the rule will remain. That I think if I may say so, is the justification why the Drafting Committee undertook on its own shoulders the responsibility of introducing the word ""backward"" which, I admit, did not originally find a place in the fundamental right in the way in which it was passed by this Assembly....



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.",

undertakes “duties and responsibilities” the scope of which depends  on  his
situation and the technical means he uses.  The Court cannot  overlook  such
a person’s “duties” and “responsibilities” when  it  enquires,  as  in  this
case,  whether  “restrictions”  or  “penalties”  were   conducive   to   the
“protection  of  morals”  which  made  them  “necessary”  in  a  “democratic
society”.”

      Mr. Subramanium,  learned  senior  counsel  has  emphasised  that  the
freedom of expression as protected by Article 10  of  ECHR  constitutes  an
essential basis of a democratic society and any limitations on that  freedom
have to be interpreted strictly.   Mr. Subramanium has also referred  us  to
Editorial Board of Pravoye Delo and  Shtekel  v.  Ukraine[38],  wherein  the
European Court, for the first time, acknowledged that  Article 10  of  ECHR
has to be interpreted as imposing on States a positive obligation to  create
an appropriate  regulatory  framework  to  ensure  effective  protection  of
journalists’ freedom of expression on the Internet.  He has also  drawn  our
attention to Akda v. Turkey[39], wherein the European Court  has  held  that
ban on translation of classic work  of  literature  that  contained  graphic
description of sex, violated the right to freedom of expression.



32.   Mr. Nariman, learned senior counsel and amicus, has  commended  us  to
Wingrove v. United Kingdom[40] to show that  the  interpretation  placed  by
the European Court of Human Rights on Article 10 that deals with freedom  of
expression.  In the said case, a video movie characterising Saint Teresa  of
Avila in profane ways was held to be properly banned and not a violation  of
Article 10 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   The  said  case
originated from an application lodged with  the  European  Commission  under
Article 25 by a British national Nigel Wingrove on  18th  June,  1990.   The
object of the request and of the Application was to obtain a decision as  to
whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach  by  the  respondent  State
(United Kingdom) of its obligation under Article 10 of the  ECHR.   Wingrove
wrote the script  for a video and directed making of a video  work  entitled
‘visions of ecstasy’ – the idea for the film was derived from the  life  and
writings of St. Teresa of Avila, the sixteenth century  Carmelite,  nun  and
founder of many convents,  who  experienced  powerful  ecstatic  visions  of
Jesus Christ.  In paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report  it is stated:-



“... I consider that  the  same  decision  could  have  been  reached  under
paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) on grounds other than  blasphemy,  for
example the profanation of symbols, including  secular  ones  (the  national
flag) or jeopardising or prejudicing public order (but not for  the  benefit
of a religious majority in the territory concerned).  The reasoning  should,
in my opinion have been expressed in terms both of religious beliefs and  of
philosophical convictions.  It is only in paragraph 53 of the judgment  that
the words “any other” are cited.  Profanation and  serious  attacks  on  the
deeply held feelings of others or on religious  or  secular  ideals  can  be
relied on under Article 10 para 2  (art.  102)  in  addition  to  blasphemy.



“The majority of the Video Appeals Committee took the view that the  imagery
led not to a religious perception, but to a perverse one, the ecstasy  being
furthermore of a perverse kind.  That analysis was in  conformity  with  the
approach of the House of Lords, which moreover did not discuss the  author’s
intention with respect to the moral element of  the  offence.   The  Board’s
Director said that it would have taken just the same stance in respect of  a
film that was contemptuous of Mohammed  or  Buddha.   The  decision  not  to
grant a certificate  might possibly have been justifiable and justified  if,
instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had  been  a  video
showing, for example, the anti-clerical  Voltaire  having  sexual  relations
with some prince or king.  In such a case,  the  decision  of  the  European
Court might well have been similar  to  that  in  the  Wingrove  case.   The
rights of other under Article 10 para 2 (art.  10-2)  cannot  be  restricted
solely to the protection of the rights of others in  a  single  category  of
religious believers or philosophers, or a majority of them.  The  Court  was
quite right to base its decision on the protection of the rights  of  others
pursuant to Article 10 (art. 10), but to my mind it could have  done  so  on
broader grounds, inspired to a greater extent by the concern to protect  the
context of religious beliefs “or any other”, as is rightly  pointed  out  in
paragraph 53 of the judgment.  In the difficult balancing exercise that  has
to be carried out in these  situations  where  religious  and  philosophical
sensibilities are confronted by freedom of expression, it is important  that
the inspiration provided by the European Convention and  its  interpretation
should be based both on pluralism and a sense of values.”",
Article 10,"Ministry Of Defence, Government Of ... vs Cenrex Sp. Z.O.O & Ors. on 8 December, 2015",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/26155961/?formInput=Article%2010,,"(iii)   Petitioner not only had wrongly invoked the performance bond

and recovered moneys, but also the moneys thus received could have been

retained by the petitioner only if the petitioner was able to establish its case

of damages caused to it as per Article 10 of the Contract. However since the

pleadings of the petitioner filed in the arbitration proceedings did not base

itself on Article 10 of the Contract, hence, damages could not be claimed by

the petitioner under Article 10 for being adjusted against the performance

bond amount realized by the petitioner.


16.             The third conclusion given by the majority Award is that there

is no reference in the pleadings of the petitioner filed in the arbitration

proceedings to Article 10 of the Contract and therefore a claim based of the

petitioner on Article 10 is against law and cannot be looked at. These

conclusions are contained in paras 21 to 24 of the impugned Award and

these paras read as under:-

      ""21.       However, that it not to say that MOD would not, in the ordinary
      course, be entitled up to $82,245.14 in damages from Cenrex for breach of
      contract if Cenrex did fail to comply with the delivery schedule. Such a right
      to damages arises under Article 10, and clearly survives the expiry of the
      performance bond. The fact that MOD cannot rely upon the performance bond
      as a remedy does not mean that it is not entitled to bring a claim under Article
10 for liquidated damages.



      23.        Much of the agreement addressed on the pleadings does go to
      whether there was a breach of contract by Cenrex and, implicitly therefore, a
      right to damages under Article 10. Article 10 itself, however (like Article 2.3),
      does not feature at all in any of the pleadings of the parties. Latter submissions
      have sought to raise it, but the context in which those submissions are made is
      unclear and the tribunal does not consider that it is properly seized of any
      claim under Article 10.



OMP No.408/2007                                                              page 27 of 42
    24.       The tribunal therefore considers that it is bound to deal with this
   matter by allowing the claim of Cenrex and ordering payment of $82,245.14
   together with interest. The tribunal considers that interest should run from 19
   June 2004 at an annual rate of 18%.""                          (emphasis is mine)


17(i)        Once again this aforesaid conclusion and finding of the

Arbitration Tribunal is wholly perverse to say the least because even if

Article 10 of the Contract is not mentioned by reference, the entire case of

the petitioner in the arbitration proceedings has been the entitlement of the

petitioner to encash the performance bond on account of delay in deliveries

by the respondent no.1 to the petitioner and this is so stated by the Arbitrator

themselves in para 23 first line and para 22 first line of the impugned Award.

There is no law which requires that unless Article 10 of the Contract is

mentioned in the pleadings of the petitioner in the arbitration proceedings,

although the facts so as to bring the case under Articles 2.1, 2.2 and 10 of the

Contract are mentioned in the pleadings itself, it is not legally permissible

for the petitioner to urge a case for encashment and enforcement of the

performance bond on account of delays caused by the respondent no.1 in

supplying of goods under the contract.             The majority Award clearly

therefore has acted against the settled legal principles as applicable in this

country by holding that the petitioner herein was not entitled to plead a case

merely because Article 10 of the Contract is not mentioned in its pleadings

OMP No.408/2007                                                       page 28 of 42

there except the mention of Article 10.",

Article 10

 


Mr. Vice-President: We can now go back to Article No.10. The motion before the 
House is:

""That Article 10 form part of the Constitution.""

I shall now go over the amendments and then we may have a general discussion.

Amendment No. 326 is verbal and is disallowed.



Sir, my third argument is that the provision withregard to the reservation of 
seats in the legislatures for the minor ities, which must include the 
depressed classes and the scheduled tribes, according to the draft 
constitution isto be of limited duration. Now nobody can deny at thepresent 
time that a provision of this kind is necessary for these classes and it must 
be obvious to everybody here thatrepresentation in the legislature is of far 
greaterimportance than representation in services. If a communityis 
represented in the legislature, its representatives canvoice its demands from 
time to time and can see that anyinjustice done to that community either in 
the matter ofappointment to posts or in any other matter is rectified.But if 
it ceases to be represented in the legislature,whatever protection might be 
granted to it in this or thatmatter, it will be in a far more helpless 
condition than ifit were deprived of any other special aid. Now it has 
beenprovided in the Constitution that the reservation of seatsfor the minor 
ities which include the scheduled tribes anddepressed classes, who must 
according to any definition beregarded as backward, is limited to ten years. 
Article 305lays down that the provision for the reservation of seatsfor the 
minor ities which include the scheduled tribes anddepressed classes, who must 
according to any definition beregarded as backward, is limited to ten years. 
Article 305lays down that the provision for the reservation of seatsfor the 
minor ities according to their population shallcontinue in force unchanged for 
ten years and no more. Onthe expiration of then years from the commencement of 
the Constitution this ""provision shall lapse unless it soperation is 
extended by an amendment of the Constitution.Now is it not desirable that a 
similar limitation should bellaid down in clause (3) of article 10? Indeed it 
can beapplied with greater force to article 10 than to thereservation of posts 
for the minor ities in the Central andProvincial administrations. If clause 
(3) of article 10 isto be in comformity with the scheme for the protection of 
the interests of the backward classes, I submit that it is not merely 
desirable but necessary that the amendment that Ihave proposed should be made.



Lastly, Sir, I should like to know what is therelationship between clause (3) 
of article 10 and article296. Article 296 provides that the claims of minor 
itycommunities shall be taken into consideration consistentlywith the 
maintenance of efficiency in the administration in the making of appointments 
to services and posts inconnection with the affairs of the Union or of a State 
for the time being specified in Part I of the First Schedule.Now in so far as 
clause (3) of Article 10 applies to allStates specified in the First Schedule, 
the differencebetween it and article 296, which applies only to 
Statesspecified in Part I of the First Schedule, is clear. Butbeyond that it 
is far from clear what the relationshipbetween these two articles is. Article 
296 relates tominor ities. The claims of the minor ity communities can betaken 
into consideration in making appointments to servicesonly on the ground that 
they are backward. Though it is the word `minor ity' that is used, in article 
296 and theexpression `backward classes' is used in article 10 (3), itseems to 
me that in fairness to the country protection canbe granted to any class, 
whether you call it a backwardclass or a minor ity, only on the ground that it 
is backwardand if left to itself, would be unable to protect itsinterests. 
This shows the need for

 


clearing up theconnection between the two articles that I have justreferred 
to. Apart from this, I should like to know whetherif clause (3) of article 10 
were passed, it would bepossible for sections within the various communities 
to askfor special protection for themselves in the matter ofappointments to 
services or posts. It may be that if clause(3) of article 10 is passed, it 
will not be possible for theState to make any reservations in the services 
forminor ities as such. But will it not be a temptation tosections of these 
and other communities to claim that theyare backward in order to get the 
protection of clause (3) ofarticle 10? Sir, I submit that we should have a 
system thatwould not encourage fissiparous tendencies and under whichit will 
not be to the interest of any class to claim that it is backward. It is 
desirable therefore to limit theoperation of any special protection that we 
may grant--protection of whatever kind--that its duration should belimited, so 
that the legislature may from time to time beable to see how it has worked and 
how the State hasdischarged its duty towards the protected classes. Unlessthis 
is done, I venture to think that article 10 would notbe in conformity with the 
intention of the constitution toremove all those conditions on account of 
which specialprotection is necessary. We are all aware that when theReport of 
the Minor ities Committee was considered by theHouse, the entire House was 
anxious that reservations of whatever kind should be done away with as quickly 
aspossible. It was recognized that for the time being theywere necessary, but 
it was insisted on that whateverprotection might be considered necessary now, 
should begranted temporarily only, so that the population of thecountry might 
become fully integrated, and no community orclass might be tempted to claim 
special advantages for itself. On these grounds, Sir, I venture to put forward 
myamendment though I have no doubt whatsoever, that it willnot find favour 
with my friend Dr. Ambedkar.



To give a clear picture of this, Sir, I would like tostate what obtains in 
Mysore. There are two classes ofvacancies, A and B classes. For the A Class 
vacancies, boththe Brahmins and the Non-Brahmins are competent to 
apply,whereas for the B class vacancies, only the backward classesare entitled 
to compete. Sir, these backward communitiessuffer from two disabilities, 
namely, social disabilitiesand educational disabilities. It is from these two 
points ofview, that the State Government has specifically providedthe 
appointments in the B class. Therefore, Sir, it is butright that the word 
""backward"" appearing in clause (3) ofarticle 10 should be retained. 
As the Honourable Dr.Ambedkar has rightly said, the retention of the 
word`backward' will be very appropriate also for this reason,namely, that 
clauses (1) and (2) of article 10 would be nulland void if this word 
`backward' is not retained in clause(3) of article 10.",
Article 10,"Jaipur Vidyut Vitran Nigam Ltd. vs Adani Power Rajasthan Ltd. on 31 August, 2020",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/32145461/?formInput=Article%2010,,"53.   It was argued that there was no domestic coal linkage under

which supply was cut down due to any law, and APRL was not

allocated coal block, and its bid was premised on the imported coal.

In Energy Watchdog, it was opined that only changes in Indian law

could be considered under the PPA and not in foreign law. In NCDP

dated 26.7.2013, the NCDP of 2007 was modified to the effect that

power projects would only get a certain percentage of what was earlier

allowable.


54.   It is apparent from the decision dated 31.5.2013 of the Standing

Linkage Committee (Long­Term) that the application of APRL was kept

in abeyance. It applied for coal linkage on 2.7.2009 on the basis of

NCDP of 2007. The bid cut­off date was 30.7.2009, 7 days prior to the

bid deadline, the NCDP of 2007 was applicable. A decision was taken

by the Standing Linkage Committee on 14.2.2012 read with the

decision dated 31.5.2013 indicating a shortage in domestic coal and

dependence on imported coal. For the shortage of coal, APRL could

not have been made to suffer, on that it had no control.       It was

decided not to issue fresh LoAs, and all pending applications were

kept in abeyance.     The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs



decided on 21.6.2013 to reduce coal supply to 65 percent and 75

percent of ACQ for the remaining four years of the 12 th Five Year Plan.

It allowed passing through of higher cost of imported coal.                   The

Ministry of Coal was directed to suitably amend the NCDP.                     The

Ministry of Coal on 26.7.2013 amended the NCDP of 2007, and the

Ministry of Power issued a letter on 31.7.2013, which provided for

pass­through    of    additional    cost   incurred    to    meet    the      coal

requirements.      The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its

decision   dated     21.6.2013,    recognised   coal    supply,     subject     to

availability, to 4660 MW having no fuel linkage.            The Kawai Project

was included in the same.         The Policy was revised, thus assurance

given by the Government of India under the NCDP of 2007 was taken

away. The provision of 100 per cent supply was taken away. With

respect to the applicability of Energy Watchdog, a dispute has been

raised. In Energy Watchdog, it was laid down that change in law is

applicable to change in domestic law, not change in foreign law. It is

not applicable to imported coal/change in foreign law. It was urged

that application for grant of coal linkage was submitted to the Ministry

of Coal for the supply of coal in the light of assurance given under the

NCDP of 2007 in both the cases and those assurances, which were

given in the Policy, were diluted or taken away by the subsequent

scheme of the Government instrumentality.             Consequently, no coal



linkage or LoA or FSA was available in the hands of the Generator in

Energy Watchdog. The cut­off date for applicability of law was 7 days

prior to the bid deadline and change in law provision of Article 10 of

the PPA in question is similar to Article 13 of the PPA in Energy

Watchdog. Article 10 is extracted hereunder:



        “ARTICLE 10: CHANGE IN LAW

        10.1 Definitions
        In this Article 10, the following terms shall have the
        following meanings:

 10.1.1 ""Change in Law"" means the occurrence of any of
        the following events after the date, which is seven (7)
        days prior to the Bid Deadline resulting into any
        additional recurring/non­recurring expenditure by the
        Seller or any income to the Seller:

           • the enactment, coming into effect, adoption,
           promulgation, amendment, modification or repeal
           (without re­enactment or consolidation) in India, of any
           Law, including rules and regulations framed pursuant
           to such Law;



10.2 Application and Principles for computing impact
of Change in Law

10.2.1 While determining the consequence of Change in
Law under this Article 10, the Parties shall have due
regard to the principle that the purpose of compensating
the Party affected by such Change in Law, is to restore
through monthly Tariff Payment, to the extent
contemplated in this Article 10, the affected Party to the
same economic position as if such Change in Law has not
occurred.

10.3 Relief for Change in Law
10.3.1 During Construction Period
As a result of any Change in Law, the impact of
increase/decrease of Capital Cost of the Power Station in
the Tariff shall be governed by the formula given below:



         “15.6.2 Except as provided in this Agreement, all prior
         written or oral understandings, offers or other
         communications of every kind pertaining to this
         Agreement or supply of power up to the Contracted
         Capacity under this Agreement to the Procurers by the
         Seller shall stand superseded and abrogated.”


63.   Article 10 of the PPA is clearly attracted that the change in law

was in contemplation.     Article 10 cannot be made redundant; the

agreement is binding and must prevail.",
Article 10,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%2010,,"34. I hold, therefore,   that Article 10   and not Art, 9 is the residuary article, that the words ""other financial obligations"" must be read ejusdem generis with the words ""loans, guarantees"" which precede the same and should be given a restricted and technical meaning, namely, financial obligations of the nature of ""loans"" and ""guarantees"", and that the said expression would not  include non-contractual liabilities e.g. statutory liabilities for compensation for compulsory levy, requisition or acquisition. I hold further that the phrase ""actionable wrong"" which occurs   in Article 10 should   receive a wide and liberal interpretation and should be held to connote  all infringements of legal rights,  for which an action lies in law. Thus read, this Article 10 would obviously include torts and breaches of contract, which would be only two of the species, of which ""actionable wrong"" is the genus but would not, by or between themselves, exhaust the whole of it. ""Actionable wrong"" would have other categories and the present case affords one such illustration. In Article 10, however, ""breach of contract"" (which has already been provided for in Article 8 and Article 9, as above interpreted)   has been   expressly excluded and so  that Article would apply to all actionable wrongs other than ""breach of contract."" In this view, Article 10(2) (b) would clearly cover the disputed claim and the appellants cannot shake off their liability for the same.



B. K. Mukherjea J. further observed as follows:
  ""The word 'wrong' in ordinary legal language means and signifies 'privation of right'. An act is wrongful if it infringes the legal right of another, and 'actionable' means nothing else than that it affords grounds for action in law"". 

47. On this observation of B. K. Mukherjea J., Mr. Dutt appearing for the respondent    has relied and has urged that as the respondent has been kept out of the money due to him as compensation for the goods requisitioned he has suffered a wrong and as this affords a ground for action in law it is an actionable wrong and therefore Article 10. interpreted widely as the Supreme Court intended it to be interpreted, would cover the claim in the present case and therefore the liability would be that of the province   of West Bengal.    It is however difficult to accept the proposition that the mere omission to pay the statutory compensation would amount to an  actionable wrong as contemplated, in Article 10.    The suit is directly a suit for recovery of statutory compensation and not for damages in respect of an actionable wrong in the way of withholding proper compensation.   The Supreme Court decision shows that for a case to come under Article 10 there must be some wrongful act, some illegal and unauthorised act done.   The requisitioning of paddy was not an illegal or unauthorised act -- it was an act under statutory power.   It is therefore difficult to see how the claim for statutory compensation can be a liability in respect of an actionable wrong.    To bring  such a  claim within the scope of Article 10 by contending that it is really a suit for damages for an actionable wrong, to wit, withholding the payment of the compensation, appears to be to stretch the scope of Article 10 unduly; if Article 10 be used for every case in which payment is withheld, there would be no need for Article 9.



59. The Indian Independence (Rights, property and Liabilities) Order was promulgated by the Governor-General of British India under powers conferred on him by Section 9 (1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 for making an initial distribution of the assets and liabilities of undivided India and undivided Provinces between the two Dominions and the new Provinces which came into existence under that Act. The liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal were distributed by Articles 8 (2), 9 (b) and 10 (2) of the Order. Article 8 in express terms deals with contractual liability; Article 9 read with Article 8 (6) leads to the conclusion that ""liabilities in respect of loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" of the Province of Bengal which were outstanding before the appointed day, are also a special class of contractual liabilities; and then Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an ""actionable wrong other than a breach of contract"". It is not disputed that the classification of liabilities made by Articles 8, 9 and 10 is exhaustive, so that whatever is not dealt with by Articles 8 & 9 comes under Article 10. In the case of  notice was served upon the Manager of the Tripura State under the Bengal Agri. Income-tax Act calling upon him to submit a return of agricultural income received by him during the previous year. The Ruler of the State then instituted a suit in June, 1946 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca for a declaration that the aforesaid Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income-tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void and for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the assessment. The suit was transferred from the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca to the Court of a Subordinate Judge, 24-Parganas. After partition of Bengal the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the place of Province of Bengal and it raised a plea that the Court of Alipur being situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The trial Court overruled the plea, but in revision this Court reversed the decision of the trial Court upon the view that Article 10 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947 applied to tortious acts (See the decision of this Court in Province of East Bengal v. State of Tripura, 53 Cal WN 368 at p. 380) (K). On appeal the Supreme Court held that the interpretation of the expression ""actionable wrong"" as given by this Court was too narrow. The judgment of the Supreme Court is .  Patanjali Sastri J. in delivering the majority judgment observed as follows;



61. The learned Additional Government Pleader has strenuously contended before me that as the paddy was requisitioned in pursuance of a statutory authority conferred by Rule 75-A of the Defence of India Rules and as those Rules have not been challenged by the plaintiffs as ultra vires it cannot be regarded as an actionable wrong within the meaning of Article 10. It is pointed out that in the Tripura case the plaintiff challenged the constitutional validity of the Bengal Agricultural income-tax Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability on the plaintiff and as in the present case there is no challenge to the validity of the Defence of India Rules, the wrong complained of by the plaintiff cannot be said to be an actionable wrong within the meaning of Article 10. To my mind it is nothing but a confusion of thought to suggest that the plaintiffs in the present case are complaining of requisition of paddy. They do not and cannot challenge the requisition; their cause of action is based on the infringement of their statutory right to get compensation under Clause (4) of Rule 75-A. The only question therefore is whether the failure to pay statutory compensation is an actionable wrong and upon a true interpretation of that expression in the light of the observations made by the Supreme Court in the Tripura case I have no doubt that it is. This conclusion is also borne out by the decisions of this Court in the following cases; Khagendra Nath v. State of West Bengal,  (Das and Das Gupta JJ.); Ramesh Chandra Das v. Province of Bengal,  (M) (Das and P. N. Mookerjee JJ.) and Hindusthan Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd, v. State of West Bengal 59 Cal WN 405 (N) (Bose J.). In Khagendra Nath Ganguli's case (L) the suit was for a declaration that the assessment of revenue upon land was illegal and for an injunction restraining the Province of Bengal from enforcing the liability and it was held that such a suit was with respect to a liability of the Province of Bengal for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and as such is governed by Article 10 (2) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947. In the case of Ramesh Chandra Das the suit was for a declaration that an order of discharge from service served upon the plaintiff by the Province of Bengal was illegal and for a further declaration that the plaintiff might be deemed to be still in service. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Tripura case (E), Das and P. N. Moo-kerjee JJ. held that the plaintiff's claim was based on a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract, as envisaged by Article 10 (2) of the aforesaid Order of 1947. The case of Hindusthan Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd. (N), is directly in point as there is nothing to distinguish the facts of that case from the facts of the case before me. In that case the plaintiff company was the owner of certain lands in 24-Parganas. On 21-6-46, the then Government of Bengal requisitioned the lands. On or about 30-6-1947 the Land Acquisition Collector. 24-Parganas fixed and offered to pay Rs. 4,641/- per month as compensation in respect of the said lands with effect from 29-6-1946 and the plaintiff agreed to it. On 15-5-1947 the Collector sanctioned payment of the pre-partition claim then due. The State of West Bengal, however, did not pay the compensation for the period 29-6-46 to 14-8-47 on the ground that under Article 9 (b) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947 it was the liability of the Province of East Bengal, Upon these facts Bose J. held that the non-fulfilment of the statutory obligation to pay compensation is a liability in respect of an actionable wrong under Article 10 (2) (b). In interpreting the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Tripura case (E) his Lordship observes as follows at page 411.",

 In this case also, it is nto necessary to reproduce the contents of column 3. Suffice it to say that the court-fee is a fixed amount. The short argument on behalf of the appellant is that the present appeal is nto from a decree or from an order having the force of a decree and, therefore, it falls within Article 11 of Schedule Ii and nto within Article 1, Schedule I, which, for our purpose, is a residuary Article. It is added that reading these two Articles together it must follow that Article 1, Schedule I, so far as appeals are concerned, is confined only to appeals from decrees and orders having the force of decrees. The cogency of this argument depends on the meaning of the word ""judgment"" used in section 10 of the Act. No decision directly covering the construction of this section has been brought to our notice, but by way of analogy, reference has been made to the decisions construing the meaning of the word 'Judgment' occurring in clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore and in clause 15 of the Letters Patent constituting the High Courts of Judicature at Calcutta and Bombay. Reference has also been made to the definitions of the words ""judgment"" and ""decree"" contained in section 2 (9) and (2) respectively of the Civil P. C. We shall have to see, among other things, as to how far these definitions are helpful in construing the word ""judgment"" as used in section 10 of the Act.  



 5. We have arrived at this conclusion on the plain reading of section 10 of the Act in the background of the statutory scheme. In our view, the draftsman could neither have intended to restrict the right of appeal only to final judgments disposing of the entire suit, nor could he have intended it to extend to all orders made during the course of trial, however ministerial or procedural in their nature or ineffectual on the rights of the parties.  

 6. For the purpose of court-fee also therefore, the Court will have to consider in each case whether the judgment falls within the contemplation of Article 11, Schedule Ii, because of its nto amounting to a decree in the sense of finally disposing of a suit or an order having the force of a decree or whether it is a judgment which, without so amounting, otherwise materially affects the rights of the parties so as to give rise to a right of appeal under Section 10 of the Act. It may be observed that in the case in hand, the competency of the appeal is nto in question, and indeed it is common ground that the judgment is appealable. The only question which arises for our consideration is whether the present is an appeal from a decree or from an order having the force of a decree or whether it is an appeal from a judgment which is neither a decree nor an order having the force of a decree. It is also contended at the bar that the Court-fees Act, being a fiscal statute, unless it clearly falls within Article 1, Schedule I, which provides for ad valorem court-fee, this Court must give benefit 9f doubt to the citizen and hold that a fixed court-fee is payable in this case under Article 11, Schedule II. This argument seems to us to be somewhat misconceived. If the judgment does nto fall within the plain meaning of Article 11, Schedule Ii, then appeal, which is admittedly competent, would be governed by Article 1. Schedule I.  




 7. In the present case, the judgment has indisputably disposed of the suit finally, with the result that nothing more remains to be done in the trial of the suit. Whether a decree is also to be framed in agreement with the judgment under the Civil P. C. is, in our opinion, immaterial because the Act does nto take notice of decrees and in terms it provides for appeals only from judgments. The judgment under appeal, however, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to the matters in controversy in the suit and it embodies in itself the formal expression of the adjudication. Merely because as a result of the adjudication, it purports also to grant a decree, would nto deprive the judgment of the characteristics of a decree for the purposes of Court Fees Act. This judgment must, therefore, be held to amount to a decree and, therefore, excluded from the operation of Article 11, Schedule II. The Act, it may be remembered, does nto define either ""judgment"" or ""decree"". It merely makes the judgment appealable under Section 10. To be appealable, as hereinbefore discussed, the judgment, broadly stated, must be more than a mere statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order; in other words, it must contain or embody a decision on a dispute affecting the merits as well. In the case before us, the judgment also contains all the criteria of a decree and this indeed is nto contested. We are, therefore inclined to hold that this case quite clearly falls within the purview of Article 1, Schedule I and is subject to payment of ad valorem court-fee.  



 8. The learned Counsel for the parties have cited a number of decisions with the object of showing that the judgment can neither amount to a decree nor to an order having the force of a decree and that, therefore, the present case must necessarily fall within Art. 11. Sch, II. We do nto consider it necessary to refer in details to all the cases cited because none of them deals with the Act. The decisions dealing with clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court and clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta and Bombay High Courts, do seem to be of some assistance, but few of them deal with the question of court-fee, with the result that the ratio deci-dendi to most of these cases does nto throw much helpful light on the problem which we are called upon to solve. Without elaborately commenting on them, we may merely notice them in passing' In Palaniappa v. M. R. Krishnamurthy,  (FB). an order granting leave to sue in forma pauperis was held to be a judgment and, therefore, appealable. In Rajinder Parshad v. Punjab State,  (FB), an order dismissing a writ petition on the ground of delay was held to be a judgment subject to appeal under clause 10 of the Letters Patent. In Mohd. Felumeah v. S. Mondal, , it was observed that a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent (Calcutta) could nto be construed as a decree under the Civil P. C. and an ad interim injunction during the pendency of writ proceedings was held to amount to a ""judgment"". In Union of India v. Khetra Mohan, . there is an exhaustive discussion on the test as to what is a final and what is an interlocutory judgment. In that case, a suit was brought by the plaintiff on the original side of the Calcutta High Court against the Union of India for a sum of money. The trial Judge, after recording his decision on several issues, directed a reference for the ascertainment of the amount due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. The referee was directed (i) to take accounts on the footing of certain measurements for ascertainment of the amount due to the plaintiff; (ii) to determine the market rate for items of work done by the plaintiff and (iii) to ascertain whether there had been an increase in the rate of labour charges in respect of certain excess quantity of work done. In an appeal preferred by the defendant, an objection was taken by the plaintiff that the decision of the trial Judge was nto a judgment. It was held that so far as direction (i) was concerned, it should be held to be a 'judgment' within clause 15 of the Letters Patent and the order should be considered as a whole and it amounted to a preliminary decree and thus a 'judgment' within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. On this reasoning, it was held appealable on the basis of a decision of the Privy Council in Ahmed Musaji Saleji v. Hasham Ebra-him Saleji, 2nd 42 Cal 914 : (AIR 1915 Pc 116). In Sultan Singh v. Jai Chand, 1966 Delhi Lt 62, a learned Single Judge of the Punjab High Court sitting on Circuit in Delhi, laid down that an order of the Rent Controller or the Rent Control Tribunal under the Delhi Rent Act, 1958 does nto become an order having the force of a decree merely because U is executable as a decree. The order, therefore, was held nto to fall within Article 7, Schedule I, Court Fees Act We do nto consider it necessary or proper to express any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of this view. Suffice it to say that this decision does nto throw much light on the question before us. According to the Supreme Court in Asrumati Debi v. Rupendra Deb, , an order for transfer of a suit under clause 13 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court is nto a ""judgment"" within the meaning of clause 15 and no appeal lies there from because it neither affects the merits of the controversy between the parties in the suit itself, nor terminates or disposes of the suit on any ground. In this judgment, there is illuminating discussion as to the meaning of the word ""judgment"". In State of U. P. v. Vijay Anand. , the order of a Division Bench dismissing an application for review of an order under Article 226 of the Constitution was held to be a ""judgment"" within the meaning of clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Allahabad High Court. In the body of the judgment, the Court declined to reconcile the decisions of the Madras High Court on the one hand and those of Calcutta and Nagpur High Courts on the other on the interpretation of the word ""judgment."" It was, however, noticed that there was a cleavage of opinion of the scope of the expression ""judgment."" In Shankarlal v. Shankarlal Poddar, , it was observed that orders passed by the District Court or by a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in the matter of winding up petitions are appealable under section 202 of the Companies Act independently of the provisions of sections 96 and 104 of the Code or of clause 15 of the Letters Patent and tt would be sufficient if the order is judicial as distinguished from administrative or ministerial order. The Court left open the question of the scope of the expression ""judgment"" in the Letters Patent. In Taxing Officer v. Jamnadas Dharamdas, , a decree passed by the Tribunal under the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, 1951 made appealable under section 40 of that Act was held nto to amount to a decree within the meaning of the Court Fees Act. In any event, the award made by the Tribunal under that Act was nto regarded as a decree within the meaning of Schedule Ii, Article 11, Court Fees Act, with the result that the memorandum of appeal filed under section 40 of that Act was held to fall for payment of court-fee, under Schedule Ii, Art 11. In Irshad Husain v. Bakshish Husain, Air 1946 Oudh 254, an order for quashing the proceedings under section 20, U. P, Encumbered Estates Act, was held nto to amount to an order having the force of a decree and was, therefore, governed by Schedule Ii, Article U. Court Fees Act. In Kanwar Jagat Bahadur Singh V. Punjab Slate, , an award of compensation made by an arbitrator acting under the Punjab Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act was held neither to amount to a decree nor an order having the force of a decree, with the result that an appeal against such an award was held to fall under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. In Official Liquidator v. M. U. Qureshj, Air 1945 Lah 146 (FB) an executable order made under the Companies Act of 1913, which is enforceable under section 199 thereof in the same manner as a decree, was held to fall for the purposes of court-fee under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. According to Gokal Chand v. Sanwal Das, Air 1920 Lah 326, the term 'judgment' in clause 10 of the Letters Patent (Lahore) includes any interlocutory judgment which decides, so far as the Court pronouncing the judgment is concerned, whether finally or temporarily. any question materially in issue between the parties and directly affecting the subject matter of the suit. In the reported case, an order on an application to stay execution pending appeal was held to be a judgment and, therefore, appealable. In Vastulal Pareek v. Pareek Commercial Bank Ltd., , an appeal against an order passed on a claim made by a Bank under section 45-B of the Banking Companies Act, after the commencement of its winding up proceedings, was held to fall, for purposes of court-fee, under Schedule II. Article 11, Court-fees Act. In Dundappa v. S. G. Motor Transport Co., (P) Ltd., Air 1966 Mys 150, an appeal against an order refusing to wind Up a company was held to be liable to court-fee under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. In Kanak Sunder Bibi v. Ram Lakhan Pandey.  (FB), the word ""decision"" in Article 133(1) of the Constitution was held equivalent to the word ""decree"". In Ram Prasad v. Tirloki Nath. Air 1938 All 50, an order under section 5 (1), U. P. Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1934 was held nto to have the force of a decree and on appeal from such an order, Court-fee was payable under Article 11. Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act.",
Article 11,"Meyyappa Chettiar vs Chidambaram Chettiar on 17 December, 1923",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/937459/?formInput=Article%2011,,"7. Wallis, C. J., with whom Oldfield, Kumaraswami Sastri and Ramesam, JJ., agreed, stated that the property attached before Judgment does not become property attached in execution upon the passing of a decree for the plaintiff either within the meaning of Article 11 or under Order 21, Rule 57, and that Order 38, Rule 11, merely enables the decree-holder to apply for execution without a fresh attachment. But he held that where an order for sale was obtained, that order proceeds on the footing that the property is to be considered as attached in execution by virtue of Order 38, Rule 11, and that a claim put in after the order may properly be regarded as a claim to property attached in execution of the decree and therefore within Article 11 of the Limitation Act. It is to be observed that this change which the Court held occurs in the nature of the attachment only comes into operation according to this judgment when an order for sale is obtained. It does not hold that this change occurs either on obtaining a decree or on making an attempt to obtain an order for sale by issuing an execution petition. The case is therefore not any authority in favour of the present contention, because in this case there has not been any order for sale. It may be if there had been such an order that the position would be different. This judgment points out the anomalous result that if a claim is made to property attached before judgment up to the order of sale, a suit by the party affected is barred in six years, whereas, if it is made after the order of sale, it is barred in one year, and suggests that the anomaly should be put right by legislation. Emphasis was placed in the judgment on the fact that, before the limitation provisions in such cases were removed from the Code of Civil Procedure and put into the Limitation Act in 1908, there was express provision that the limitation period of one year should apply both in the case of claims to property attached in execution and to property attached before judgment, and it was thought that the Legislature could not have intended in the process of removing a section from the Code of Civil Procedure to the Limitation Act to extend the limitation period. The Court, however, was driven to the conclusion that it had done so, but confined the extension within the narrowest possible limits. No such consideration applies to this case, as the penal provision of Order 21, Rule 57, in question was, when enacted, entirely new. It is not without interest that the Court treated the meaning of Order 21, Rule 57, as not germane to the matter then in issue and that I.L.R. 42 M. 1 and the cases there quoted were not even mentioned in argument. Spencer, J., delivered a separate judgment in which he says that, if a decree is passed and an attempt is made to execute it, what was an attachment before judgment becomes in effect an attachment in execution of a decree because Order 38, Rule 11, declares that no re-attachment is necessary and, later on, he says he finds no difficulty in classing a claim put in after the properties were brought to sale in execution proceedings under the heading of "" Claims preferred to property attached in execution of a decree,"" and he declined to express an opinion on the hypothetical case of a claim put in to property attached before judgment before the decree and the commencement of the execution proceedings. I doubt if he meant by his judgment to go further than the rest of the Court, and to extend the principle enunciated by them to claims made where there was a decree but no execution proceedings, or to claims made after execution proceedings had been commenced. If he did so intend, his observations were obiter and I prefer the judgment of the rest of the Court, which in my judgment strained the language of the article in question in going even as far as it did. However this may be, 1 find nothing in that judgment when carefully examined which militates against the view expressed in I.L.R. 42 Mad 1, which I think was rightly decided. As there has been no order for sale in this case, and nothing but an abortive attempt to obtain, and for that purpose to make use of an existing attachment, it is not necessary here to decide what the position would be after an order for sale had been obtained. I can find nothing in the rule to make the failure to proceed expeditiously with the execution petition involve the loss of all rights acquired by the attachment before judgment. 1 would answer the question in the affirmative.



19. The first note of dissent from this view was struck in Gones Chandra v. Banwari Lal (1813) 16 CLJ 86. The learned Judges (one of whom was Sir Cecil Brett) dissent from I.L.R. 12 Bom. 400 and I.L.R. 33 Cal. 639. The decision in I.L.R. 29 Cal. 773 (in which Brett, J., was one of the Judges) was not referred to nor is the closely connected question, the possibility of the conversion of an attachment before Judgment into one in execution, discussed. This decision was referred to in Bavuddin Sahib v. Arunachala Mudali (1913) 26 MLJ 215, where their Lordships say: ""The other contention of the appellant, namely, that....the present decree-holder converted the attachment before Judgment into an attachment in execution is not sustainable. Such conversion can take place only if the decree-holder applies for sale of all the properties in execution of his own decree. Whether such conversion will take place even in such a case may be questioned on the authority of Gones, Chandra v. Banwari Lal (1912) 16 CLJ 86, but it is unnecessary to decide that question for the purposes of this case. "" This decision far from being an authority in favour of the respondent is, as the expression of an opinion, against him. It is true the last sentence above quoted leaves the point before us open. But the immediately preceding sentence indicates the view that the attachment before Judgment will be converted into one in execution on the application of the decree-holder for sale. The next case supposed to be in favour of the respondent is Suraparaju v. Narasimham (1914) 1 LW 932. It does not appear from the facts that any application for execution was dismissed for default. There was no reference either in the argument or in the Judgment to Order 21, Rule 57, or to the cases above discussed. The next decision relied on by the respondent is Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1. It purports to be based on 16 Call. L. J. 86, 26 M.L.J. 215 and I L. W. 932. The last two decisions are scarcely authorities for it. So that, we have, as against the decisions and opinions that prevailed from 1869 to 1911, two decisions in 1912 and 1918 in favour of the respondent. In this state of the authorities we got the decision in Arunachalam Chetti v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 : 41 MLJ 256 (FB); here the question arose with reference to the words "" attached in execution of a decree"" in Article 11 of the Limitation Act. A Full Bench of five Judges held that, after an order for sale was passed after the decree, an attachment before Judgment becomes an attachment in execution. Wallis, C. J., said referring to Order 38, Rule 11: ""This provision does not, in my opinion, enable us to say that property attached before Judgment becomes property attached in execution of a decree upon the mere passing of a decree for plaintiff either within the meaning of Article 11 of the Limitation Act or Order 21, Rule 57, already mentioned, as execution may never be applied for, but merely enables the decree-holder to apply for execution by sale of the attached property without a fresh attachment. Where, however, as in the present case, there is an order in execution for the sale of the attached property, that order appears to me to proceed upon the footing that the property is to be considered as attached in execution by virtue of Rule 11, etc. "" This was concurred by three other Judges (of whom I was one). Spencer, J., though he may be regarded as going further than the others, certainly agreed with them to the extent that, at least after the order for sale, the attachment before Judgment becomes one in execution. The Judgment is therefore an unanimous Judgment of five Judges laying down an attachment before Judgment may be converted into an attachment in execution of a decree and is binding on this Court; and when we remember that the Limitation Act and Civil Procedure Code are allied General Acts (first passed together in 1859, again in 1877 and again in 1908) and ought to be construed consistently [See Phoolbas Koonwar v. Lalla Jogeshar Sahoy (1875) ILR 1 C 226 at 242 (PC) and Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 at 909], it is seen that it will be a great anomaly without any justification if the same expression is construed in one way in Section 63 of the Civil Procedure Code and Article 11 of the Limitation Act and in another way for Order 21, Rule 57, of the C. P. Code. If the character of an attachment before Judgment is such that its conversion into an attachment in execution is impossible, such impossibility exists equally for the purpose of Section 63, C. P. C, and Article 11 of the Limitation Act as for Order 21, Rule 57. Unless there is a clear indication to the contrary in one or more of these provisions, the possibility of such conversion equally applies to all and I see no reason to depart from ILR 44 Mad. 902, which definitely established the possibility of such conversion.



37. The petitioner relies strongly upon the ruling reported in Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 MLJ 256 (FB), which laid down that Article 11 of the Indian Limitation Act, which deals with the question of the limitation period for an order on a claim petition preferred to "" property attached in execution of a decree, "" applies to an order on a claim petition preferred to property attached before Judgment after an order for sale in execution had been passed. Three points have to be noted with reference to this case; first, that it was a case of a claim made after decree, after an application for execution had been put in and after an order for sale in execution had been passed; secondly, that Section 246 of the old Civil Procedure Code of 1859, which the Judges held to be the fous et origo of Article 11 of the Indian Limitation Act, applied expressly in terms to an attachment before Judgment as well as to an attachment in execution; and thirdly, that they were oppressed by the facts that, despite the provisions of the old Code, the legislature had provided no special period of limitation at all for claims to property attached before Judgment, and that, unless ""the whole object of the summary claim procedure"" was to be "" frustrated, "" a briefer period of limitation than that in Article 120 had to be found somewhere. The learned Chief Justice and the other learned Judges, who adopted his Judgment in that case, considered that they "" should not be justified in laying down generally that property attached before Judgment is attached in execution of a decree"" and they distinctly held that Order 21, Rule 57, threw no light on the point that had been then argued before them. I do not think this ruling goes further than to say that a claim put in after there is an order in execution for sale following upon on attachment before Judgment "" may properly be regarded as a claim to property attached in execution of a decree within the meaning of Article 11 "" of the Limitation Act. It cannot, therefore, be construed to lay down that in all instances where the phrase "" property attached in execution "" occurs in any statute, it covers cases of property attached before judgment as soon as execution is taken out on the decree arising out of that judgment; it must, in my opinion in view of the compulsion, if it may be so called, exercised over their Lordships' minds, by the omissions of the Legislature, be strictly confined to what it lays down. I cannot, therefore, read into it a reversal of the decision in Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1. That is a direct authority in favour of the respondent in this case, to which one of the learned Judges in the I.L.R., 44 Madras case was a party, and other direct authorities quoted therein are Gones Chandra Adak v. Banwari Lal Roy (1912) 16 CLJ 86 and Bavuddin Sahib v. Arunachala Mudali, (1913) 26 MLJ 235 and another case, which indirectly is in favour of the respondent, Kosuri Suraparaju v. Mandapaka Narasimham, reported in 26 I. C, 81.



41. There is authority on both sides. In Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1 it was held that Order 21, Rule 57, had no application to attachments before judgment. The Judges followed one Calcutta and two Madras decisions on the point The Calcutta case [Gones Chandra Adak v. Banwari Lal Roy (1912) 16 CLJ 86 is certainly a direct authority in support of their view. One of the Madras cases (Bavuddin Sahib v. Aruna-chala Mudali (1913) 26 MLJ 215 is--if anything--an authority for the opposite view. What it actually decided was that an attachment before judgment did not cease to exist because an application for the arrest of the judgment-debtor had been dismissed for default. That is not in point here. Incidentally, however, the opinion was expressed that an attachment before judgment was converted into an attachment in execution where the decree-holder applied in execution for sale of the attached property. At the same time, a doubt was raised, with reference to the Calcutta decision, whether the opinion was correct, a doubt which the Judges expressly refrained from solving. The last case Kosuri Suraparaju v. Mandapaka Narasimham (1914) 1 LW 932 is not very clear. Apparently an execution application had been dismissed. If it was dismissed for default, the decision i:  a direct authority in support of Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata (1918) ILR 42 M 1. On the other side--apart from dicta in certain cases--there is Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 : 41 MLJ 256 (FB). In that case property had been attached before judgment, a decree had been passed and an order for sale had been granted in execution. The question the Court had to decide was whether the words "" property attached in execution of a decree "" in Article 11 of the Limitation Act covered an attachment before judgment. The Full Bench decided that they did. The main judgment was delivered by Wallis, C. J., with whom all the other Judges concurred. Spencer, J., delivered a separate judgment which--as I understand it--went no further than that of the Chief Justice. It must be conceded that the particular instance with which the Court was concerned was one in which sale had actually been ordered; but I cannot agree that fact affects the principle of the decision. An order for sale pre-supposes and is based on an existing attachment. It does not itself create the attachment. If therefore an attachment before judgment becomes at any stage an attachment in execution, it must, in my view, be at the stage where an application to execute has been made and admitted under Order 21, Rule 17. And that I conceive to be the principle laid down by the Full Bench. I may add that, in the present case, sale papers had been called for which is usually done after attachment has been ordered. I am unable to see how a subsequent order for sale would have altered the position. Wallis, C. J. explicitly stated that he was considering both cases, that is, those "" in which the claim ... is put in after decree or even, as in the present instance, after sale had been ordered in execution."" Further on he observed: ""This provision (Order 38, Rule 11) does not, in my opinion, enable us to say that property attached before judgment becomes property attached in execution of a decree upon the mere passing of a decree either within the meaning of Article 11 of the Limitation Act or of Order 21, Rule 57, as execution may never be applied for."" This sentence seems to me to indicate (a) that he was considering the meaning of the phrase under discussion both in Article 11 of the Limitation Act and in Order 21, Rule 57 (b) that he was of opinion nothing more was necessary to convert an attachment before judgment into an attachment in execution than an application to execute. The order for sale he regarded as "" proceeding on the footing that the property had to be considered as having been attached in execution by virtue of Rule 11."" The reference to Rule 11 requires an application to execute (and such an application would, but for the proviso in the rule itself, be for attachment as well as sale) is to my mind conclusive proof that he considered that the attachment changed its character from the time of the application to execute. And that was the view taken by Spencer, J. Wallis, C. J., no doubt remarked that Order 21, Rule 57, threw no light on the question he was considering. Nor did it. He was considering the meaning of a certain expression in Art 11 of the Limitation Act which was practically identical in terms with a phrase in Order 21, R.57, but found that the context-in which the latter stood gave him no assistance in interpreting the former.",
Article 11,"Kumarika Subarna Rekha Mani Devi And ... vs Ramakrishna Deo And Ors. on 1 December, 1966",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/12627/?formInput=Article%2011,,"In other words though under Article 11 an order rejecting the plaint is deemed to be a ""decree"" within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and a decree so defined is specifically excluded from the definition of ""order"" in Section 2(14) C.P.C., did that Article deal with orders m generic term without regard to the above definitions in the C.P.C. It was held that Article 11 is not applicable as it certainly excluded orders of rejection of plaints from the purview of that Article. The Madras amendment, however, gave a different heading, viz.. memorandum of appeal when the appeal is from an order inclusive of an order determining any question under Section 47 or Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which gave rise to a contention that this amendment did not adhere to the definition of ""order"" under Section 2(14) C.P.C. and had by re-defining it to include what was excluded under it, by its inclusion in the word ""decree"" as defined in Section 2(2). Even though the word ""decree"" or ""order"" has not been defined in the Central Court-fees Act, under Section 3 of the present Act these words unless the context otherwise requires are to have the same meaning as those given in the C.P.C. 



  "". . . . it is to be observed, that though those two are included in the word 'order' no doubt because they would be otherwise be excluded as being things to be reckoned amongst decrees and not amongst orders: an order rejecting a plaint, which is to be deemed to be a decree under the Code of Civil Procedure, is not included under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act."" 

 On a consideration it appears to me that ii ""order"" is used in its generic term to include all orders including those deemed to have been included within the definition of ""decree"" under Section 2(2) C. P. C. thrn there was no purpose in again including that in the word ""order"" as used either in Article 11 of Schedule  II of the Madras amend-ment or in Article 3 of Schedule  II of the present Act. If Articlp 3 Schedule  II of the Act taken as giving a new definition of the word ""order"", even then that does not specifically include orders under Order 7, Rule 11 C. P C. The conclusion is therefore inescapable hat orders under Order 7 Rule 11 C.PC. dealing with the rejection of plaints do not come within the purview of Article 11 of Schedule  II of the Central Act as amended by the Madras Act or under Article 3 Schedule  II of the present Act.  



 The learned Chief Justice after considering the definitions of 'order' and 'decree' under Section 2(14) and Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code observed thus :-- 
  ""I think that the Court-fees Act, which Itself contains no definition of either the word 'order' or the word decree must have meant to follow the definition contained in the Code of Civil Procedure and I am strongly confirmed in this view by the words of Article 11 of Schedule  II which include in the word 'order' orders determining questions under Sections 47 and 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure. These are orders and it is quite unnecessary to say that the words 'memorandum of appeal when the appeal is from an order', are to include these orders if they would be included without their being specifically mentioned; and when one looks to find why it is that the Court-fees Acf has gone out of its way to say that 'order' in Article 11 of Schedule  II shall include two particular named orders, one finds the solution very ready to hand by looking at the definition of decree in the Civil Procedure Code because that definition deems as decrees not only orders rejecting plaints but also orders under sections 47 and 144, the very things referred to in Article 11 of Sch IT of the Court-fees Act: and it is to be observed, that though those two are included in the word order no doubt because they would otherwise be excluded as being things to be reckoned amongst decrees and not amongst orders, an order rejecting a plaint, which is to be deemed to be a decree under the Code of Civil Procedure is not included under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act."" 



 35. It must be remembered that nune of these cases approved of the contention that court fee in such cases was payable under Article 11, Schedule II of Act. 1870. All these indeed, were cases in which the Question of rejection of plaint on the grounds slated in Clauses (b) and (c) of Order VII. Rule 11 did arise and not on grounds in Clause (a) or (d) with which we are now concerned. The only case that dealt with this aspect, however, was . That was a case where the plaint in a suit to recover damages of Rs 10,000 for malicious prosecution had been rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) C. P. C. The memorandum of appeal was filed with a court fee stamp of Rs 2 instead of Rs. 475 on Rs. 10,000 Relihance was placed on Schedule II, Article 11 of the Court-fees Act for the contention that the fixed court fee paid was sufficient. The learned Judges held that the order being under Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Codo which is deemed to be a decree it would not be covered by Schedule II, Article 11. Then reliance was placed on the Full Bench decision of the NaRpur High Court in AIR 1949 Nag 1 (FB) (Supra). Wanchoo C. J.. (as he then was) who delivered the opinion of the Court said that -",

     69.        It is also submitted by the Counsels that Clause 4 of the
     SHA, categorically states that the provisions of clause 11, 12, 14
     and Schedule 1 shall apply in relation to any transfer, or proposed
     transfer, of shares or any interest in shares and the said clauses of
     SHA being in consonance with the Articles, clearly overrides the
     alleged transfer Clause of MoU, rendering the MoU invalid and
     contrary to Articles and provisions of the Companies Act. In this



      regard, they state, alleged MoU was superseded by the valid and
     existing SHA and thereafter the terms of SHA were incorporated
     in Articles of 1996, Articles of 2012 and as on date, Articles of
     2014. It is also pointed out that even the respondent No.3 while
     seeking transfer of his shares in the joint name of petitioner and
     himself, sought the transfer in terms of Articles 11 (i) and 13 of
     the Company, whereas on respondent No.2's request, even after
     sharing all the requisite documents required and requested
     transfer of shares by respondent No. 2 in terms of Article 11 (i)
     and 13 of the Company, respondent No.3 initially tried to reject
     the transfer ostensibly on ground that 'the due process for shares
     has not been followed', whereas a joint transfer in his name and
     the petitioner was concluded by relying on the same Articles and
     later, on a repeated request by respondent No.2 vide email dated
     October 10, 2019 after sharing all the requisite documents,
     respondent No. 3 informed respondent No.2 that under the
     provisions of an undated MoU, the transfer was not permitted.",
Article 11,"Mrs. Panzy Fernandas vs Mrs. M.F. Queoros And Ors. on 12 October, 1962",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1731487/?formInput=Article%2011,,"On the same date, i. e., the 21st December, 1959 the Stamp Reporter made a report to the effect that the court-fee on the said memorandum of appeal was payable not under Schedule II Article 11, but under Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. The amount of court-fee payable under Schedule II Article 17 (vii) of the Act, according to the Stamp Reporter, was Rs. 50/-, hence there was a deficiency of Rs. 45/- in the court-fee. On the 15th May, 1961, the appellant filed objections to this office report, and took up the position that the court-fee on the memorandum of appeal filed by her was payable under Schedule II Article 11, and not under Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. On this objection having been filed, a learned Judge of this Court passed an order on the 25th January, 1960, that the matter be put up before the Taxing Officer. 



 2. On behalf of the appellant, the learned counsel argued that the court-fee payable on a memorandum of appeal under Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act is governed by Schedule II Article 11, and not by Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. According to Schedule II Article 11 of the Act a court-fee of Rs. 5/- is payable in Uttar Pradesh on a ""memorandum of appeal when the appeal is not from a decree, or an order having the force of a decree"" and is presented to the High Court. This provision of law would, therefore, be applicable only to a case where the appeal is not from a decree, or an order having the force of a decree! The question that arises for determination in the present case, therefore, is whether the order appealed against can be described as a decree or an order having the force of a decree. 



 If executability was to be the invariable quality of all decrees, one would expect that the Legislature would incorporate this feature in the provisions which define the nature, scope and contents of a decree. Further, if the Legislature wanted that Schedule II Article 11 should apply only to executable orders it could very easily have added the word ""executable"" before ""order"". 

 10. The view that an ""order having the force of a decree"" should be executable appears to be based on confusion between an order that has the force of a decree, and an order that is enforceable as a decree. Schedule II Article 11 of the Act clearly states that the order should have the force of a decree. It does not state that the order should be enforceable as a decree. The distinction between the two cases, though fine, is clear. 



 13. The learned Counsel for the appellant has also cited In re B. Venkataratnam, AIR 1941 Mad 639 in which it is held that Schedule II Article 11 applies to cases in which the statute provides that an order shall be subject to an appeal as if it were a decree. A perusal of the judgment of this case, however, shows that the learned Judges in that case based their view on the special amendment of Schedule II Article 11 as made in Madras. In any case, this decision nowhere goes to the length of laying down a negative proposition to the effect that unless there is an express provision in the statute that an order has the force of a decree, it cannot be regarded as such. If the intention of the Legislature was that only those orders are to have the force of decree in respect of which there is an express statutory provision to that effect, then one would expect that the statute should, instead of using the words ""order having the force of a decree"", have used the words ""order having the force of a decree under some statute"". The interpretation suggested, therefore, involves the addition of certain words not found in the provision of law in question, and is not warranted by the phraseology of Article 11 as it stands at present.",
Article 11,"The State Of Madhya Pradesh vs Seth Gowardhandas S/O Seth ... on 17 October, 1992",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/434808/?formInput=Article%2011,,"2. In order to highlight the points in controversy and to answer to the reference, it is necessary to state the material facts in brief which are as follows: 
  The State Government through its Land Acquisition Officer, has acquired 3 acres of land of Survey Number 477 belonging to the claimant/respondent situated in village Udaipura for which the Collector, Raisen made an award of compensation payable to the respondent. The claimant/respondent, being dissatisfied with the award, made an application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in brevity ""L.A. Act"") for referring the matter to the Court for enhancement of the compensation. The learned District Judge, Raisen, made an award enhancing the amount of compensation at the rate of Rs. 20,000/ - per acre, to be paid to the respondent. The appellant, State of Madhya Pradesh, being dissatisfied by the enhanced award made by the Civil Court, has preferred the present appeal under Section 54 of the L.A. Act and ad valorem Court fees has been paid on the memorandum of appeal on its valuation. The claimant/respondent has also preferred cross-objection under Order 41, Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for brevity ""the Code"") claiming further enhancement of compensation at the rate of Rs. 22,000/- per acre. The respondent has valued the cross-objection at Rs. 33,000/ - but has not paid ad valorem Court fees and has paid fixed Court fees as prescribed under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the Court Fees Act, 1870 (in brevity ""the C.F. Act""). A preliminary controversy surfaced before the referring Division Bench, whether fixed Court fees under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the C.F. Act is payable on the memorandum of appeal filed under Section 54 of the L.A. Act and the Cross-Objections in such appeals or ad valorem Court fees is payable under Article 1-A of Schedule 1 of the C.F. Act. On the strength of two Division Bench decisions of this Court rendered in First Appeal No. 15 of 1984 (Land Acquisition Officer, Seoni v. Laxminarain) decided on 7-8-1991 and reported in 1991 (2) MPJR 203, as well as First Appeal No. 35 of 1988 (Smt. Ganabai v. State of M.P.) decided on 24-4-1991 it was canvassed on behalf of the claimant/ respondent who was filed the cross-objection that only fixed Court fees under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the Court Fees Act, 1870 is payable on the memorandum of appeal as well as on the cross-objection. 



 On the aforesaid conclusions their Lordships further took the view that the term ""decree"" used in Schedule 2, Article 11, is referable to decree as defined in Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as the decision of the Tribunal in the aforesaid case before the Supreme Court did not fulfil the requirements of a ""decree"" as mentioned above, the said decision of the Tribunal was not accepted as a decree within the meaing of Schedule 2, Article 11 of the C.F. Act and, therefore, it was held that the memorandum of appeal filed by the appellants squarely fell within the ambit of Schedule 2, Article 11 of the Court Fees Act and as such ad valorem Court fees under Schedule I Article 1, was not leviable.

 This Article 11 itself eloquently speaks about its applicability. It applies when the appeal is not from a decree or an order having the force of decree. As held by Supreme Court in Diwan Brothers Case (supra), in order to attract application of Article 11, the following conditions must be fulfilled.



 18. In the aforementioned context a reference of a decision of Calcutta High Court In Re Anunda Lal AIR 1932 Cal 346, may be also made with advantage, in which it was held as under at page 349 : 
  ""Section 8 standing in the text of the Act proceeds upon the assumption that otherwise in the Act there is a charge which is an ad valorem charge and is not fixed charge; and the only way in which it can be said that there is a charge has to be computed is that the charge is imposed by Article I, Schedule 1. The provision of Section 8 involving as they do that the fee in the class of cases dealt with is ad valorem fee are themselves sufficient to exclude any question of Article 11, Schedule 2, being made applicable to such cases. Section 8 shows one perfectly clearly that an appeal regarding compensation in a land acquisition cases is not under Article 11, Schedule 2, because it is not a fixed fee at all"".",

(a) The order of the Division Bench dated December 1910 dismissing the appeal from the order dated August 1909 passed on the claim petition was passed without jurisdiction as no appeal lay against the latter order.

(b) Even if such an appeal lay the one year's period mentioned in the third column of the Article 11 of second schedule of the Limitation Act commenced in August 1909 (the date of the original order allowing the claim petition) and not from the date of the appellate order (December 1910).



(6-1) As the appellate order did not interfere with the original order it could not be held to have superseded the original order,
 

(6-2) As even if it superseded the original order the order mentioned in the third column of Article 11 means the original order the legislature not having in Article 11 used the words "" final decision or order ""(as the legislature did in Article 13) and not having expressly postponed the commencement of the limitation period to the date of the final order [as it did in Clause (2) of Article 182],
 




4. I might at once say that with very great deference I am unable to agree with the opinion of the learned Judge that the proper article applicable is not Article 11 of the Limitation Act but Article 13. The proceedings in an appeal against an order passed in a petition case are a continuation of the proceedings commenced by the petition and hence the appellate order is also an order on the same claim petition and as Article 11, Clause (1), specifically deals with a suit which is allowed to be brought by the legislature to contest the order on a claim, Article 13 cannot be applied. Their Lordships of the Privy Council have held that the suit itself so brought is in the nature of a review of the order passed in the claim petition and that it is a mistake to treat the action brought under Section 283, Civil Procedure Code, as an original action (see Phulkumari v. Ghanshyam Misra (1908) I.L.R. 35 Calc. 202 (P.C.) and Krishnappa Chetty v. Abdul Khader Saheb (1914) 26 M.L.J., 449 at p. 456.



9. It was however urged that because in two or three other articles of the Limitation Act special provision is made for counting the period from the date of the appellate order when there has been an appeal and no such special provisions are found in Article 11, therefore the legislature intended the date of the original order to be the starting point so far as the suits mentioned in Article 11 are concerned even when there has been a Letters Patent Appeal. It appears to ma that there are at least two answers to this argument. One answer is that the fact that the legislature in order to remove all doubts and with abundant caution has specially made provision in some cases for the contingency of an appeal, namely, that the order passed in the appeal was to be the starting point in those cases, that fact is not a sufficient reason for not construing the word ""order"" found in Article 11 as the only subsisting order passed on the claim petition (where there has been an appeal) in accordance with recognized principles of jurisprudence. Secondly, there seems to be at least one other article in the Limitation Act in which there is no express reference to the contingency of an appeal and to the decree passed on such an appeal, but the legislature must have intended that the starting point must be the date of the final appellate decree (in case there had been an appeal) and not the original decree. I refer to Article 175 which says that an application for payment of the decree amount by instalments under the Civil Procedure Code should be made within six months from the date of ""the decree."" Such an application is made under Order XX, Rule 11, Clause (2), and it cannot surely be held that where the Original Court passes a decree for a certain sum of money and the plaintiff appeals to the Appellate Court on the ground that he ought to have been decreed a larger sum but his appeal is dismissed an application under that order and rule cannot be made by the judgment-debtor after six months from the date of the original decree but within six months of the date of appellate decree even though the decree-holder consented to such an order being made.",
Article 11,"Nogendra Lal Chowdhury vs Fani Bhusan Das on 15 January, 1918",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1430218/?formInput=Article%2011,,"1. The only question to which we need address ourselves in this appeal is the question of limitation. In the course of certain execution proceedings the property now in dispute was attached. The present plaintiff preferred a claim to the property under Order XXI, Rule 58, Code of Civil Procedure. The claim was rejected and he brought this suit to establish his title to the property and for consequential reliefs. It is not disputed that if the order made in the execution proceedings rejecting the claim was an order within the scope of Order XXI, rule, 63, the present suit is a suit of the nature contemplated by that rule and is governed as to limitation by Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1908. The period of limitation prescribed in such a suit is one year from the date of the adverse order in the claim case. Here the suit was instituted more than a year after the claim was rejected. The defend-ant No. 1 pleaded, therefore, that the suit was out of time. The contention put forward on the plaintiff's behalf is that the claim having been rejected for default and without investigation, the order of rejection was not an order within Order XXI, Rule 63 and Article 11 had no application. The contention proved successful in the Courts below and the appeal before us has been preferred by this defendant No. 1. Now it may be useful to cite in this connection the language used by Lord Hobhouse in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Sardhari Lal v. Ambika Pershad 15 I.A. 123 : 15 C. 521 : 5 Sar. P.C.J. 172 : 12 Ind. Jur. 210 : 7 Ind. Dec. (N.S.) 931. Lord Hobhouse said: ""The order"" that is, the order in the claim case to which he was referring, ""was made and it was an order within the jurisdiction of the Court that made it. It is not conclusive; a suit may be brought to claim the property, not with-standing the order; but then the law of limitation says that the plaintiff must be prompt in bringing his suit. The policy of the Act evidently is to secure the speedy settlement of question of title raised at execution sales and for that reason a year is fixed as the time within which the suit must be brought.""



2. If that was the policy of the law under the Civil Procedure Cede of 1877 and the Limitation Act of the same year, it is still more emphatically the policy of the law under the present Civil Procedure Code and the present Limitation Act.

3. On the plaintiff's behalf reliance has been placed on decisions of this Court under Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1877 but those decisions are no longer of authority because the language of Article 11 has been altered in the Act of 1903. The change made follows the change made in Section 283 of the Code of 1832 now represented by Rule 63 of Order XXI. Section 283 ran as follows: ""The party against whom an order under Section 280, 281 or 282 is passed may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute."" Rule 63 on the other hand says that where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in 'dispute. The specific reference to the previous sections or rules has been omitted. A corresponding change has been made in Article 11. The ground, therefore, on which the cases under the previous Limitation Act and the previous Code were decided, that the section specifically referred to in Article 11 and Section 283 of the Code required some investigation to be made, is gone. Rule 63 of the present Civil Procedure Code and Article 11 of the present Limitation Act are quite general in their terms. All that is now necessary is that a claim should be preferred under Rule 58 and that there should be an order either allowing or rejecting it. The party against whom the order is made may then bring a suit in the language of Rule 63 ""to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute"" or in the language of Article 11 ""to establish the right which he claims to the property comprised in the order"", and the suit must be brought within the year allowed by Article 11.



5. The case of Umacharan Bhattacharjee v. Hironmoyee Debi 26 Ind. Cas. 943 : 18 C.W.N. 770 was decided in 1918, but the Article applied was Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1877 and the case is of no assistance to the plaintiff. No doubt the learned Judges there held that Article 11 of the Act of 1877 was not applicable where there had been no investigation of the claim. But at the same time they referred to the change which had been made in the language of Article 11 by the Act of 1908 and remarked that the change might have altered the law.



6. The view we take is supported by the two decisions of the Madras High Court in Narasimha Chetti v. Vijiapala Nainar 27 Ind. Cas 944 : 2 L.W. 206 and Ponnusami Pillai v. Samu Ammal 38 Ind. Cas. 937 : 31 M.L.J. 247 in which the learned Judges pointed out that the language of Article 11 of the Act of 1908 was more comprehensive than the language of the preceding Act and refused to restrict the Article to those oases in which an investigation had taken place.

7. The result is that this appeal must be allowed and the whole suit dismissed with costs, both here and in the Courts below. But the dismissal of the suit will be without prejudice to any right which the plaintiff may have as against the defendant No. 2.",

     It is  also necessary  to add  that  merely  because  a
juristic entity	 may be an ""authority"" and therefore ""State""
within the  meaning of Article 12, it may not be elevated to
the position of ""State"" for the purpose of Articles 309, 310
and 311	 which find  a place  in Part XIV. The definition of
""State"" in  Article 12	which includes an ""authority"" within
the  territory	 of  India  or	under  the  control  of	 the
Government of  India is	 limited in  its application only to
Part III  and by  virtue of  Article 36, to Part IV: it does
not extend  to the  other provisions of the Constitution and
hence a juristic entity which may be ""State"" for the purpose
of Parts  III and IV would not be so for the purpose of Part
XIV or	any other provision of the Constitution. That is why
the decisions  of this	Court in S. L. Aggarwal v. Hindustan
Steel Ltd.  and other  cases involving	the applicability of
Article 311 have no relevance to the issue before us.



 The  learned   counsel  appearing	 on  behalf  of	 the
respondents Nos.  6 to	8, however,  relied strongly  on the
decision in  Sabhajit Tewary  v. Union of India & Ors(2) and
contended that this decision laid down in no uncertain terms
that a	society registered  under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860 can never be regarded as an ""authority"" within the
meaning of  Article 12.	 This being  a decision	 given by  a
Bench of  five Judges  of this	Court is undoubtedly binding
upon  us  but  we  do  not  think  it  lays  down  any	such
proposition as	is contended  on behalf	 of the respondents.
The question  which arose in this case was as to whether the
Council of  Scientific and  Industrial	Research  which	 was
juridically  a	 society  registered   under  the  Societies
Registration Act, 1860 was an ""authority"" within the meaning
of  Article 12.  The  test  which  the	 Court	applied	 for
determining this  question was the same as the one laid down
in the	International Airport  Authority's case and approved
by us, namely, whether the Council was an instrumentality or
agency of  the Government.  The Court implicitly assented to
the proposition	 that if  the Council  were an agency of the
Government, it	would undoubtedly  be an  ""authority"".	But,
having regard to the various

features enumerated in the judgment, the Court held that the
Council was  not an agency of the Government and hence could
not be	regarded as  an ""authority"".  The Court did not rest
its conclusion	on the ground that the Council was a society
registered under  the Societies	 Registration Act, 1860, but
proceeded to  consider various other features of the Council
for arriving  at the conclusion that it was not an agency of
the Government	and therefore not an ""authority"". This would
have been  totally unnecessary if the view of the Court were
that a	society registered  under the Societies Registration
Act can	 never be  an  ""authority""  within  the	 meaning  of
Article 12.



 The decision  in Sukhdev  Singh v.	 Bhagat Ram (1975) 3
SCR 619 was also strongly relied upon by the learned counsel
for respondents	 Nos. 6	 to 8  but we  fail to	see how this
decision  can	assist	the  respondents  in  repelling	 the
reasoning in  the International	 Airport Authority's case or
contending that	 a company or society formed under a statute
can  never   come  within  the	meaning	 of  the  expression
""authority"" in Article 12. That was a case relating to three
juristic bodies, namely, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission,
the Industrial	Finance Corporation  and the  Life Insurance
Corporation and	 the question  was whether they were ""State""
under Article 12. Each of these three juristic bodies was a
corporation created  by a  statute and the Court by majority
held that  they were  ""authorities""  and  therefore  ""State""
within the meaning of Article 12. The Court in this case was
not concerned with the question whether a company or society
formed under a statute can be an ""authority"" or not and this
decision does  not therefore  contain anything	which  might
even remotely  suggest that  such a  company or	 society can
never be  an ""authority"". On the contrary, the thrust of the
logic in  the decision,	 far from being restrictive, applies
to all juristic persons alike, irrespective whether they are
created by a statute or formed under a statute.



This was  again reiterated  by this  Court in  International
Airport Authority's case (supra) at page 1042 of the Report.
It must	 therefore now be taken to be well settled that what
Article 14  strikes at	is arbitrariness  because any action
that is	 arbitrary, must  necessarily  involve	negation  of
equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by
the courts  is not  para-phrase of  Article 14 nor is it the
objective and  end of  that Article. It is merely a judicial
formula for determining whether the legislative or executive
action in  question is	arbitrary and therefore constituting
denial of  equality. If the classification is not reasonable
and does  not satisfy  the two conditions referred to above,
the impugned  legislative or  executive action would plainly
be arbitrary  and the guarantee of equality under Article 14
would be breached. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness
in State  action whether  it be of the legislature or of the
executive or  of ""authority""  under Article 12, Article  14
immediately springs  into action and strikes down such State
action. In  fact, the  concept of  reasonableness  and	non-
arbitrariness pervades	the entire constitutional scheme and
is a golden thread which runs though the whole of the fabric
of the Constitution.",

Article 12  forms part of Part III of the Constitution which

     There are	three aspects of Article 12 which require to
be particularly noticed. These aspects are
	  (i) the  definition given  in Article 12 is not an
	  explanatory  and  restrictive	 definition  but  an
	  extensive definition,
	  (ii) it  is the  definition of the expression ""the
	  State"" and  not of  the term	""State"" or ""States"",
	  and
	  (iii) it  is inserted	 in the Constitution for the
	  purposes of Parts III and IV thereof.
     As pointed	 out  in  Craies  on  Statute  Law,  Seventh
Edition, page  213, where an interpretation clause defines a
word  to   mean	 a   particular	 thing,	 the  definition  is
explanatory  and   facie  restrictive;	 and   whenever	  an
interpretation clause  defines a  term to include something,
the  definition	 is  extensive.	 While	an  explanatory	 and
restrictive definition	confines the  meaning  of  the	word
defined to  what is  stated in the interpretation clause, so
that wherever  the word	 defined is  used in  the particular
statute in  which that interpretation clause occurs, it will
bear only that meaning unless where, as is usually provided,
the subject  or context	 otherwise  requires,  an  extensive
definition expands  or	extends	 the  meaning  of  the	word
defined to  include within  it what would otherwise not have
been comprehended in it when the word defined is used in its
ordinary sense. Article 12 uses the

word  ""includes"".   It	thus  extends  the  meaning  of	 the
expression ""the	 State"" so as to include within it also what
otherwise may  not have been comprehended by that expression
when used in its ordinary legal sense.



 Article 12 defines the expression ""the State"" while the
other Articles	of the	Constitution referred to above, such
as Article 152 and Article 308, and clause (58) of section 3
of the	General Clauses	 Act defines  the term	""State"". The
deliberate use	of the	expression ""the State"" in Article 12
as also	 in Article  36 would  have normally shown that this
expression was	used to denote the State in its ordinary and
Constitutional sense  of an  independent or  sovereign State
and the	 inclusive clause  in Article 12 would have extended
this meaning  to include  within its scope whatever has been
expressly set  out in  Article 12.  The	 definition  of	 the
expression ""the	 State"" in  Article 12,	 is however, for the
purposes of  Parts III	and  IV	 of  the  Constitution.	 The
contents of these two Parts clearly show that the expression
""the State""  in Article 12 as	also in	 Article 36  is	 not
confined  to   its  ordinary  and  Constitutional  sense  as
extended by  the inclusive portion of Article 12 but is used
in the	concept of  the State in relation to the Fundamental
Rights guaranteed  by Part  III of  the Constitution and the
Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Part IV of
the Constitution which Principles are declared by Article 37
to be  fundamental to  the governance  of  the	country	 and
enjoins upon the State to apply in making laws.



     What is  the position  before us?	Is it  only one case
decided on a concession and another based upon an assumption
that a Government Company is ""the State"" under Article 12?
349
That is	 the position  in fact	but not	 in substance. As we
have seen,  authorities constituted  under, and corporations
established   by,    statutes	have   been   held   to	  be
instrumentalities and  agencies of  the Government in a long
catena of  decisions of	 this  Court.  The  observations  in
several of these decisions, which have been emphasised by us
in the passages extracted from the judgments in those cases,
are general  in their  nature and  take in  their sweep	 all
instrumentalities and agencies of the State, whatever be the
form which  such instrumentality or agency may have assumed.
Particularly   relevant	  in   this   connection   are	 the
observations of	 Mathew, J.,  in Sukhdev Singh and others v.
Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and another, of Bhagwati,
J., in	the International  Airport Authority's case and Ajay
Hasia's case  and of  Chinnappa Reddy,	J., in Uttar Pradesh
Warehousing   Corporations    case.   If    there   is	  an
instrumentality or agency of the state which has assumed the
garb of	 a Government  company as  defined in section 617 of
the Companies Act, it does not follow that it thereby ceases
to be  an instrumentality  or agency  of the  State. For the
purposes of  Article 12 one must necessarily see through the
corporate veil	to ascertain whether behind that veil is the
face of	 an instrumentality  or agency	of  the	 State.	 The
Corporation, which  is the  Appellant in  these two  Appeals
before us,  squarely falls  within these observations and it
also satisfies	the various tests which have been laid down.
Merely because	it has	so far	not the	 monopoly of  inland
water transportation  is not  sufficient to divest it of its
character of  an instrumentality  or agency of the State. It
is nothing  but the  Government operating behind a corporate
veil, carrying	out a governmental activity and governmental
functions of  vital public  importance. mere  can thus be no
doubt that the Corporation is ""the State"" within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution.",

drawn by the learned counsel for the contract labour from the
cases laying down the principles as to under what circumstances a
Government company or undertaking will fall within the meaning

We shall preface our  discussion of  those cases by indicating that
for purposes of enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed in
Part III of the Constitution the question whether  a Government
Company or undertaking is State within the meaning of Article
12 is germane. It is important to notice that in these cases the
pertinent question is appropriateness of the Government - which is
the appropriate Government within the meaning of CLRA Act;



whether, the Central or the State Government, is the appropriate
Government in regard to the industry carried on by the
Central/State Government Company or any undertaking and not
whether such Central/State Government company or undertaking
come within the meaning of Article 12.	The word State is
defined in Article 12  which is quoted in the footnote.
	In Sukhdev Singh & Ors. vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh
Raghuvanshi & Anr.  , this Court, in the context whether service
Regulations framed by statutory corporations have the force of
law, by majority, held that the statutory corporations,	 like ONGC,
IFFCO, LIC established under different statutes fell under other
authorities and were, therefore, State within the meaning of
that term in Article 12 of the Constitution. The Court took into
consideration the following factors,  (a) they were owned,
managed and could also be dissolved by the Central Government;



In Ajay Hasia etc. Vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors.
etc.  ,	  the question	decided by a Constitution Bench of this
Court was: whether Jammu & Kashmir Regional Engineering
College, Srinagar, registered as a society under the Jammu &
Kashmir Registration of Societies Act, 1898, was State within
the meaning of	Article 12 of the Constitution so as to be
amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.  Having
examined the Memorandum of Association and the Rules of the
Society, the Court decided that the control of the State and the
Central Government was deep and pervasive and the society was a
mere projection of the State and the Central Government and it
was, therefore, an instrumentality or agency of the State and
Central Government and as such an authority-state within the
meaning of Article 12.



From the above discussion,  it follows that the fact of being
instrumentality of a Central/State Govt.  or  being State within
the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution  cannot be
determinative of the question as to whether an industry carried on
by a Company/Corporation or an instrumentality of the Govt. is
by or under the authority of the Central Government for the
purpose of or within the meaning of the definition of appropriate
Government in the CLRA Act. Take the case of a State
Government corporation/company/undertaking set up and owned
by the State Government which is an instrumentality or agency of
the State Government  and is engaged in carrying on an industry,
can it be assumed that the industry is carried on under the
authority of the Central Government, and in relation to any
industrial dispute concerning the industry can it be said that the
appropriate Government is the Central Government?  We think
the answer must be in the negative.  In the above  example if,	as a
fact,  any industry is carried on by the  State Government
undertaking under the authority of the Central Government, then
in relation to any industrial dispute concerning that industry, the
appropriate Government will be the Central Government.	This is
so not because it is agency or instrumentality of the Central
Government but because the industry is carried on by the State
Govt. Company/Corporation/Undertaking under the authority of
the Central Government.	 In our view, the same reasoning applies
to a Central Government undertaking as well.  Further, the
definition of establishment in CLRA Act takes in its fold purely
private undertakings which cannot be brought within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution. In such a case how is
appropriate Government determined for the purposes of CLRA
Act or Industrial Disputes Act? In our view, the test which is
determinative is: whether the industry carried on by the
establishment in question is under the authority of the Central
Govt? Obviously, there cannot be one test for one part of
definition of establishment and another test for another part.
Thus, it is clear that the criterion is whether an
undertaking/instrumentality of Government is carrying on an
industry under the authority of the Central Government and not
whether the undertaking is instrumentality or agency of the
Government for purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution, be it of
Central Government or State Government.",
Article 12,"Sukhdev Singh & Ors vs Bagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi And ... on 21 February, 1975",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/974148/?formInput=Article%2012,,"contemplated  in  Article 12  for  two	 principal  reasons.
First,	one  of the, attributes of a State is  making  laws.
The State exercises governmental functions and the executive
power  of  the State is co-extensive  with  the	 legislative
power  of the State.  Second, authority as  contemplated  in
Article 12 means a body of persons established	 by  statute
who  are  entitled  as such body to  command  obedience	 and
enforce	 directions  issued by them on pain of	penalty	 for
violation.   On these grounds it was said that these  corpo-
rations	 cannot	 make laws like a State and  cannot  enforce
directions.



This  Court in Rajasthan State Eeletricity Board, Jaipur  v.
Mohan & Ors. (1967) 3 S.C.A. 377) said that an ""authority is
a public administrative agency or corporation having  quasi-
governmental powers and authorised to administer a  revenue-
producing   public   enterprise. The	 expression   ""other
authorities""  in Article 12 has been held by this  Court  in
the  Rajasthan Electricity Board case to- be wide enough  to
include	 within it every authority created by a statute	 and
functioning  within  the territory of India,  or  under	 the
control of the Government of India.  This Court further said
referring  to earlier decisions that the  expression  ""Other
authorities""  in Article 12 will include all  constitutional
or  statutory  authorities on whom powers are  conferred  by
law.   The  State itself is envisaged under Article  298  as
having the right to carry on trade and. business.  The State
as

defined	 in  Article 12 is comprehended	 to  include  bodies
created	 for the purpose of promoting economic interests  of
the  people.   The circumstance that the statutory  body  is
required to carry on some activities of the nature of  trade
or  commerce  does  not	 indicate that	the  Board  must  be
excluded from the scope of the word ""State."" The Electricity
Supply	Act  showed  that  the	Board  had  power  to	give
directions,  the  disobedience of which is punishable  us  a
criminal  offence.   The power to issue	 directions  and  to
enforce compliance is an important aspect.
The  concurring Judgment in the Rajasthan Electricity  Board
case  said  that  the Board was	 invested  by  statute	with
extensive  powers of control over electricity  undertakings.
The power of the Board to make rules and regulations and  to
administer the Act was said to be in substance the sovereign
power of the State delegated to the Board.
In the British Boardcasting Corporation v. Johns  (Inspector
of Taxes) (1965) 1 Ch. 32) it was said that persons who	 are
created	 to carry out governmental purposes  enjoy  immunity
like  Crown  servants.	 Government  purposes  include	 the
traditional   provinces	 of  Government	 as  well  as	non-
traditional  provinces	of  Government	if  the	 Crown	 has
constitutionally  asserted  that they are to be	 within	 the
province   of	government.    The   British	Boardcasting
Corporation  was  held	not to be  within  the	province  of
government  because  broadcasting was not  asserted  by	 the
government  to	be within the province of  government.	 The
Wireless Telegraphy Act provided for regulation of  wireless
telegraphy  by	a system of licences.  The  Court  gave	 two
reasons	 as  to	 why the Broadcasting  Corporation  was	 not
within the province of the government.	If the	Broadcasting
Corporation  was exercising functions required	and  created
for the purpose of government. it is difficult to see why  a
licence	 was  required	to be issued to it.   Again,  it  is
difficult  to  understand why in the event of  an  emergency
powers	should be given to the Postmaster-General to  direct
that the broadcasting stations of the Corporation should  be
deemed to be in possession of Her Majesty if it be the	fact
that  such  stations  are  already  used  for  purposes	  of
exercising  functions required and created for	purposes  of
the Government.



The  Oil and Natural Gas Commission is owned by the  Govern-
ment.	It  is	a statutory body and  not  a  company.	 The
Commission   has  the  exclusive  privilege  of	  extracting
petroleum.  The management is by the Government.  It can  be
dissolved only by the Government.
The  Life Insurance Corporation is owned by  the  Government
The  life insurance business is nationalised and  vested  in
the  Corporation.   No	other  insurer	can  carry  on	life
insurance  business.  The management is by  the	 Government.
The dissolution can be only by the Government.
The  Industrial	 Finance Corporation is under  the  complete
control and management of the Central Government.   Citizens
cannot be shareholders.	 Certain specified institutions like
Scheduled Banks, Insurance Companies, Investment Trusts	 and
Co-operative  Banks may apply for the shares.	The  Central
Government  may	 acquire shares held by	 shareholders  other
than  the  Development Bank.  After  such  acquisition,	 the
Government  may	 direct that the entire undertaking  of	 the
Corporation  shall be vested in the Development	 Bank.	 The
Corporation cannot be dissolved except by the Government.
In the, background of the provisions of the three Acts under
consideration,	the  question  arises as  to  whether  these
corporations  can  be described to be authorities  with	 the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.  In the Rajasthan
Electricity  Board case it was said that the power  to	give
directions, the disobedience of which must be punishable  as
a  criminal  offence would furnish one of  the	reasons	 for
characterising	the body as an authority within the  meaning
of Article, 12.	 The power to make rules or regulations	 and
to  administer or enforce them would be one of the  elements
of  authorities	 contemplated in  Article 12.	 Authorities
envisaged  in Article 12 are described as  instrumentalities
of  State  action. on behalf of the State it  was  contended
that  the  Oil	and  Natural  Gas  Commission  as  well	  as
Industrial Finance Corporation was not granted immunity from
taxation  and  therefore  the liability to  be	taxed  would
indicate  that	the Corporation was not a  State  authority.
Reference  is made to Article 289 which speaks of  exemption
of property and income of a State from Union taxation.	 The
liability to taxation will not detract from the	 Corporation
being  an  authority  within  the  meaning  of	Article 12.
Article 289 empowers Union to impose tax in respect of trade
or business carried on by or on behalf of a State.
The  Oil  and Natural Gas Commission Act  confers  power  of
entry  on  employees  of the Commission	 upon  any  land  or

In  Civil Appeal No. 115 of 1974, the judgment of  the	High
Court is set aside.  The Finance Corporation is an authority
within	the meaning of Article 12.  The regulations  of	 the

High  Court that the Association is not entitled to raise  a

MATHEW, J.-The question whether a public corporation of	 the

of far reaching im  portance.",
Article 12,"K.Marappan vs The Deputy Registrar Of Co-Operative ... on 29 September, 2006",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/186075/?formInput=Article%2012,,"It is clear from the above conclusion that the five-Judge Bench approved the earlier decisions of two Full Benches that no writ petition is maintainable as against a co-operative society. The five-Judge Bench has held that the same needs no reconsideration and reiterated that no writ will lie against a co-operative society.

	4.  In the referring order Katju, C.J. (as he then was) speaking for the Bench has observed that there can be two kinds of co-operative societies - one which can be regarded as an instrumentality of the State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, and the other which is not an instrumentality of the State within the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution. While a writ will lie against a co-operative society falling under the first category, no writ will lie against a co-operative society, which falls under the second category. Whether a co-operative society is an instrumentality of the State under Article 12 of the Constitution or not will depend upon the various tests laid down by the Supreme Court in various decisions, e.g whether there is deep and pervasive control of the Government, extent of the shareholding of the Government, etc. It cannot be laid down as a universal proposition, that no writ can ever lie against a co-operative society.  It will depend on the nature of the society and various other factors. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, (2002) 5 SCC 111 and certain other Supreme Court decisions.



In paragraph 12 it has been held that no writ would issue where dismissal was not in violation of any statutory provision. No reinstatement could be ordered. 

	13. In Federal Bank Limited Vs. Sagar Thomas, (2003) 10 SCC 733, the Supreme Court explained and distinguished the decision in Anadi Muktas case (cited supra). In that case, the 1st respondent who was working as a Branch Manager in the appellant Bank was chargesheeted and ultimately awarded punishment of dismissal. The 1st respondent challenged his dismissal by filing a writ petition before the High Court. A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition was taken by the appellant Bank saying that it is a private bank and not a State or its agency or instrumentality within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, hence, a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable against it. The learned single Judge, however, found that the Federal Bank performs a public duty, and as such it comes under the definition of other authority within the meaning of Article 12, and as such the writ petition was maintainable. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the learned single Judge, the appellant preferred a writ appeal. The said writ appeal was dismissed providing that the learned single Judge shall decide the writ petition on merits. The question which fell for consideration before the Supreme Court on appeal was as to whether the appellant Bank is a private body or falls within the definition of the State or local or other authorities under the control of the Government within the meaning of Article 12. Allowing the appeal, the Court held that a private company carrying on banking business as a Scheduled Bank, cannot be termed as an institution or a company carrying on any statutory or public duty. Mere regulatory provisions to ensure that commercial activity carried on by private bodies work within a discipline, neither confer any status upon the company nor put any obligation upon it which may be enforced through issuance of a writ under Article 226. It was merely a case of disciplinary action being taken against its employee by the appellant Bank. The respondent was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the Bank. The termination of service, therefore, cannot be challenged by the respondent by filing a writ petition under Article 226. The decision in Anadi Muktas case was distinguished as in that case the writ petition was held to be maintainable, since the teacher whose services were terminated by the institution was affiliated to the university and was governed by the ordinances, casting certain obligations which it owed to the petitioner. The Court also elaborately discussed the six factors which have been enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia and held that such private companies would normally not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons, as there may be statutory provisions which need to be complied with by all concerned, including the private companies. For example, there are certain legislations like the Industrial Disputes Act, the Minimum Wages Act, the Factories Act or for maintaining proper environment, say the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, etc., or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such statutory provisions a writ may certainly be issued for compliance with those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispenses with the services of its employee in violation of the provisions contained under the Industrial Disputes Act, in innumerable cases the High Court interfered and has issued writ to the private bodies and the companies in that regard. But, the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or violation of any statutory provision by the private body. In that event, the writ may not be issued at all. Other remedies as may be available, may have to be resorted to. 



Thus, the question as to whether the co-operative Society is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution was expressly kept open. 

 16. Learned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to the decision of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri Konaseema Co-op. Central Bank Limited Vs. N.Seetharama Raju, AIR 1990 AP 171. The question before the Full Bench was whether a Co-operative Central Bank registered under the A.P. Co-operative Societies Act is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. The Bench held that the control vested in the Government and the Registrar, particularly, the power to divide, amalgamate or merge the societies, power to conduct elections to the Committee (disabling the society to conduct such election itself), power to supersede the Committee, power to recover amounts due to the society as arrears of land-revenue, power to provide common cadres for the employees of several independent societies, as also the extensive power to give binding directions vested in both the Government and the Registrar, not only in the interest of shareholders, depositors and creditors, but also in the interest of the public and of co-operative movement, is liable to be characterised as deep and pervasive control, within the meaning of the 4th test in Ajay Hasias case. The Bench, however, noted that the appellant Banks main object was to raise funds to finance its members and functions of Bank were not of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, and therefore, it cannot be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12. The Bench held that if in a given case a particular co-operative society can be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution (applying the tests evolved by the Supreme Court in that behalf) it would also be an authority within the meaning, and for the purpose of Article 226 of the Constitution. In such a situation, an order passed by a society against its employee in violation of the bye-laws can be corrected by way of a writ petition. This is not because the bye-laws have the force of law, but on the ground that having framed the bye-laws prescribing the service conditions of its employees the society has to follow them in the interest of fairness. If it is left to the sweet will and pleasure of the society either to follow or not to follow bye-laws, it would be inherently arbitrary and may very likely give rise to discriminatory treatment. A society which is a State, has to act in conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution and for that reason it would be made to follow bye-laws. The Bench also held that the bye-laws made by a so-operative society do not have the force of law, and hence, where a society cannot be characterized as a State the service conditions of its employees governed by bye-laws cannot be enforced through a writ petition. The Bench further held that even if a society cannot be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12, even so a writ would lie against it to enforce a statutory public duty which an employee is entitled to enforce against a society. In such a case, it is unnecessary to go into the question whether the society is being treated as a person or an authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. What is material is the nature of the statutory duty placed upon it and the Court will enforce such statutory duty.



 19. Learned Advocate General also placed reliance on the decision in G.Bassi Reddy Vs. International Crops Research Institute, (2003) 4 SCC 225. The question involved in that case was whether a writ petition would lie against ICRISAT which was set up as a non-profitable research and training centre by the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research is a State or other authority within the meaning of Article 12. Applying the test in Pradeep Kumar Biswas Case, it was held that ICRISAT is not a State  or other authority as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution. The following observations of the Bench is pertinent to note:- (SCC p.237)
	Para - 27: It is true that a writ under Article 226 also lies against a person for any other purpose. The power of the High Court to issue such a writ to any person can only mean the power to issue such a writ to any person to whom, according to the well-established principles, a writ lay. That a writ may issue to an appropriate person for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III is clear enough from the language used. But the words and for any other purpose must mean for any other purpose for which any of the writs mentioned would, according to well-established principles issue.",
Article 12,"Zee Telefilms Ltd. & Anr vs Union Of India & Ors on 2 February, 2005",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/404603/?formInput=Article%2012,,"A perusal  of the above Article  shows that the definition  of State in 
the said Article includes the Government of India, Parliament of India, 
Government of the State,  Legislatures of the States, local authorities as also 
""other authorities"".  It is the argument of the Board that it does not come 
under the term ""other authorities"", hence is not a State for the purpose of 
Article 12.  While the petitioner contends to the contrary on the ground that 
the various activities of the Board  are in the nature of public duties.  A 
literal reading of the definition of State under Article 12 would not  bring the 
Board under the term ""other authorities""  for the purpose of Article 12.  
However, the process of judicial interpretation has expanded  the scope of  
the term ""other authorities"" in its various judgments.  It is on this basis that 
the petitioners contend that the Board would come under  the expanded  
meaning of the term ""other authorities""   in Article 12 because of its 
activities which is that of a public body discharging public function.  



Assuming that these facts are correct the question then is, would it 
be sufficient to hold the Board to be a State for the purpose of Article 12?

There is no doubt that Article 19(1)(g) guarantees to all citizens the 
fundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any trade 
occupation or business and that such a right can only be regulated by the 
State by virtue of Article 19(6). Hence, it follows as a logical corollary 
that any violation of this right will have to be claimed only against the 
State and unlike the rights under Articles 17 or 21 which can be claimed 
against non state actors including individuals the right under Article 
19(1)(g) cannot be claimed against an individual or a non State entity. 
Thus, to argue that every entity, which validly or invalidly arrogates to 
itself the right to regulate or for that matter even starts regulating the 
fundamental right of the citizen under Article 19(1)(g), is a State within 
the meaning of Article 12 is to put the cart before the horse. If such logic 
were to be applied every employer who regulates the manner in which his 
employee works would also have to be treated as State. The pre-requisite 
for invoking  the enforcement of a fundamental right under Article 32 is 
that the violator  of that right should be a State first.  Therefore, if the 
argument of the learned counsel  for the petitioner is to be accepted then 
the petitioner will have to first establish that the Board is a State under 
Article 12 and it is violating  the fundamental rights of the petitioner. 
Unless this is done  the petitioner cannot allege that the Board violates 
fundamental rights and is therefore State within Article 12.  In this 
petition under Article 32 we have already held  that the petitioner has 
failed to establish that the Board is State within the meaning of Article 12. 
Therefore assuming there is violation of any fundamental right by the 
Board that will not make the Board a ""State"" for the purpose of Article 12.



Thus, it is clear that when a private body exercises its public 
functions  even if it is not a State, the aggrieved person has a remedy not 
only under the ordinary law but also under the Constitution, by way of a 
writ petition under Article 226.  Therefore, merely because a non-
governmental body exercises some public duty that by itself would not 
suffice to make such body a State for the purpose of Article 12. In the 
instant case the activities of the Board do not come under the guidelines 
laid down by this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas case (supra), hence 
there is force in the contention of Mr. Venugopal that this petition under 
Article 32 of the Constitution is not maintainable.
At this stage, it is relevant to note another contention of               
Mr. Venugopal that the effect of treating the Board as State will have far 
reaching consequences in as much as nearly 64 other national sports 
federations as well as some other bodies which represent India in the 
international forum in the field of art, culture, beauty pageants, cultural 
activities, music and dance, science and technology or other such 
competitions will also have to be treated as a ""State"" within the meaning 
of Article 12, opening the flood gates of litigation under Article 32.   We 
do find sufficient force in this argument. Many of the above mentioned 
federations or bodies do discharge functions and/ or exercise powers 
which if not identical are at least similar to the functions discharged by 
the Board.  Many of the sport persons and others who represent their 
respective bodies make a livelihood out of it (for e.g. football, tennis, 
golf, beauty pageants etc.). Therefore, if the Board which controls the 
game of Cricket is to be held to be a State for the purpose of Article 12, 
there is absolutely no reason why other similarly placed bodies should 
not be treated as State.  The fact that game of Cricket is very popular in 
India also cannot be a ground to differentiate these bodies from the 
Board. Any such differentiation dependent upon popularity, finances and 
public opinion of the body concerned would definitely violate Article 14 
of the Constitution, as any discrimination to be valid must be based on 
hard facts and not mere surmises (See State of Kerala v. T.P. Roshana, 
(1979) 1 SCC 572) Therefore, the Board in this case cannot be singly 
identified as ""other authority"" for the purpose of Article 12. In our 
opinion, for the reasons stated above none of the other federations or 
bodies referred to hereinabove including the Board can be considered as a 
""State"" for the purpose of Article 12.



used in Article 12 therefore remain, to use the words of 
Cardozo (Benjamin Cardozo : The Nature of the Judicial 
Process), among ""the great generalities of the 
Constitution"" the content of which has been and 
continues to be supplied by courts from time to time.""

	What is necessary is to notice the functions of the Body concerned.  A  
`State' has different meanings in different context.  In a traditional sense, it 
can be a body politic but in modern international practice, a State is an 
organization which receives the general recognition accorded to it by the 
existing group of other States.  Union of India recognizes the Board as its 
representative.  The expression ""other  authorities"" in Article 12 of the 
Constitution of India is 'State' within the territory of India as 
contradistinguished from a State within the control of the Government of 
India.  The concept of State under Article 12 is in relation to the fundamental 
rights guaranteed by Part-III of the Constitution and Directive Principles of 
the State Policy contained in Part-IV thereof.  The contents of these two 
parts manifest that Article 12 is not confined to its ordinary or constitutional  
sense of an independent or sovereign meaning so as to include within its fold 
whatever comes within the purview thereof so as to instill the public 
confidence in it.",
Article 12,"Thalappalam Ser.Coop.Bank Ltd.& Ors vs State Of Kerala & Ors on 7 October, 2013",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/37517217/?formInput=Article%2012,,"4.    Mr. K. Padmanabhan Nair, learned senior counsel appearing for some  of
the societies submitted that the views expressed by the  Division  Bench  in
Thalapalam Service Co-operative Bank  Ltd.  (supra)  is  the  correct  view,
which calls for our approval.  Learned senior counsel took  us  through  the
various provisions of the Societies Act as  well  as  of  the  RTI  Act  and
submitted that the societies are autonomous bodies and  merely  because  the
officers functioning under the Societies Act have  got  supervisory  control
over the societies will not make the  societies  public  authorities  within
the meaning of Section 2(h) of the RTI Act.   Learned  senior  counsel  also
submitted that these societies are not owned,  controlled  or  substantially
financed, directly or indirectly, by the State Government.   Learned  senior
counsel also submitted that the societies are not statutory bodies  and  are
not performing any public functions and will not come within the  expression
“state” within the meaning under Article 12 of the Constitution of India.



12.    We  are  in  these  appeals  concerned  only  with  the  co-operative
societies registered or deemed  to  be  registered  under  the  Co-operative
Societies Act, which are not owned, controlled or substantially financed  by
the State or Central Government or formed,  established  or  constituted  by
law made by Parliament or State Legislature.

Co-operative Societies and Article 12 of the Constitution:

13.   We may first examine, whether the Co-operative Societies,  with  which
we are concerned,  will  fall  within  the  expression  “State”  within  the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India  and,  hence  subject  to
all  constitutional  limitations  as  enshrined   in   Part   III   of   the
Constitution.  This Court in U.P. State Co-operative Land  Development  Bank
Limited v. Chandra Bhan Dubey and others (1999) 1  SCC  741,  while  dealing
with the question of the maintainability of the writ  petition  against  the
U.P. State Co-operative  Development  Bank  Limited  held  the  same  as  an
instrumentality of the State and an authority mentioned  in  Article 12  of
the Constitution.   On facts, the Court noticed  that  the  control  of  the
State Government on the Bank is all pervasive and that the  affairs  of  the
Bank are controlled by the State Government though it is  functioning  as  a
co-operative society, it is an  extended  arm  of  the  State  and  thus  an
instrumentality of the State or authority as mentioned under Article 12  of
the Constitution. In All India Sainik Schools  employees’  Association  v.
Defence Minister-cum-Chairman Board of Governors,  Sainik  Schools  Society,
New Delhi and others (1989) Supplement 1  SCC 205, this Court held that  the
Sainik School society is “State” within the meaning of  Article 12  of  the
Constitution after having found that the entire  funding  is  by  the  State
Government and by the Central Government and the overall  control  vests  in
the governmental authority and the main object of  the  society  is  to  run
schools and prepare students for the purpose feeding  the  National  Defence
Academy.



18.   We have, on facts, found that the Co-operative Societies,  with  which
we are concerned in these appeals,  will  not  fall  within  the  expression
“State” or “instrumentalities of the State” within the  meaning  of  Article
12  of  the  Constitution  and  hence  not  subject  to  all  constitutional
limitations as enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.  We may,  however,
come across situations where a body or organization though not  a  State  or
instrumentality of the State, may still satisfy  the  definition  of  public
authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Act, an aspect which  we
may discuss in the later part of this Judgment.



(a) Body owned  by  the  appropriate  government  –  A  body  owned  by  the
appropriate government clearly falls under Section 2(h)(d)(i)  of  the  Act.
A body owned, means to have a good legal title to  it  having  the  ultimate
control over the affairs of that body, ownership takes in its fold  control,
finance etc.   Further discussion of this concept  is  unnecessary  because,
admittedly, the societies in question  are  not  owned  by  the  appropriate
government.

(b)   Body Controlled by the Appropriate Government

      A body which is controlled by  the  appropriate  government  can  fall
under the definition of public authority under  Section  2h(d)(i).   Let  us
examine the meaning of the expression “controlled” in  the  context  of  RTI
Act and not  in  the  context  of  the  expression  “controlled”  judicially
interpreted while examining  the  scope  of  the  expression  “State”  under
Article 12 of the Constitution or in the context  of  maintainability  of  a
writ against a body or authority under Article 226 of  the  Constitution  of
India.       The word “control” or “controlled” has not been defined in  the
RTI Act, and hence, we have  to  understand  the  scope  of  the  expression
‘controlled’ in the context of the words which exist  prior  and  subsequent
i.e. “body owned” and “substantially financed”  respectively.   The  meaning
of the word “control” has come up for consideration in several cases  before
this Court in different contexts.  In State of West Bengal  and  another  v.
Nripendra Nath Bagchi, AIR 1966 SC  447  while  interpreting  the  scope  of
Article 235 of the Constitution of India, which confers control by the  High
Court over  District  Courts,  this  Court  held  that  the  word  “control”
includes the power to take disciplinary action and all other  incidental  or
consequential  steps  to  effectuate  this  end  and  made   the   following
observations :",
Article 13,"Article 13 in Constitution of India
          
  

  
     [Constitution]",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/134715/,,,

Article 13,"Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru ... vs State Of Kerala And Anr on 24 April, 1973",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/257876/?formInput=Article%2013,,"Although ""law"" must ordinarily include Constitutional law there is a clear 
demarcation between ordinary law which is made in the exercise of 
legislative power and Constitutional law, which is made in the exercise of 
constituent power. In the context of Article 13, ""law"" must be taken to 
mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power 
and not amendments to the Constitution made in the exercise of 
constituent power with the result that Article 13(2) does not affect 
amendments made under Article 368.



29. He observed as follows:
It is true that there is no complete definition of the word ""law""' in the 
article but it is significant that the definition does not seek to exclude 
Constitutional amendments which it would have been easy to indicate in 
the definition by adding ""but shall not include an amendment of the 
Constitution"".
30. He further observed:
The meaning of Article 13 thus depends on the sense in which the word 
""law"" in Article 13(2) is to be understood. If an amendment can be said to 
fall within the term ""law"", the Fundamental Rights become ""eternal and 
inviolate"" to borrow the language of the Japanese Constitution. Article 13 
is then on par with Article 5 of the American Federal Constitution in its 
immutable prohibition as long as it stands.



(6) As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act 
holds the field, the validity of the two impugned Acts, 
namely, the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 
1953, and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of 1962, as 
amended by Act XIV of 1965, cannot be questioned on the 
ground that they offend Articles 13, 14 or 31 of the 
Constitution.
42. It must be borne in mind that these conclusions were given in the light of the 
Constitution as it stood then i.e. while Article 13(2) subsisted in the Constitution. It was 
then not necessary to decide the ambit of Article 368 with respect to the powers of 
Parliament to amend Article 13(2) or to amend Article 368 itself. It is these points that 
have now to be decided.



(3) Article 368 is not controlled by Article 13(2) and the prohibitory 
injunction in Article 13(2) is not attracted against the amending power; 
(4) Constitutional amendment under Article 368 is not a law within the 
meaning of Article 13(2);
(5) The scale of value embodied in Parts III and IV is not immortal. Parts 
III and IV being parts of the Constitution are not immune from 
amendment under Article 368. Constition-makers could not have intended 
that the rights conferred by Part III could not be altered by giving effect to 
the policies of Part IV.",

	In our view,   this thinking of the High Court is erroneous. 
The only restriction on the power of the CBDT is to prevent it 
from interfering  with the course of assessment of any particular 
assessee or the discretion of the Commissioner of Income-Tax 
(Appeals). It would be useful to recall the background against 
which this circular was issued. 

The Income-tax authorities were seeking to examine  as to 
whether the assessees were actually residents of a third country on 
the basis of alleged control of management therefrom.  
We have already extracted the relevant provisions of Article 
4 which provide that, for the purposes of the agreement, the term 
'resident of a contracting State' means any person who under the 
laws of that State is liable to taxation therein by reason of his 
domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of 
similar nature.  The term 'resident of India' and 'the resident of 
Mauritius' are to be construed accordingly.  Article 13 of the 
DTAC lays down detailed rules with regard to taxation of capital 
gains. As far as capital gains resulting from alienation of shares are 
concerned, Article 13(4) provides  that the gains derived by a 
'resident' of a contracting State  shall be taxable only in that State. 
In the instant case, such capital gains derived by a resident of 
Mauritius shall be taxable only in Mauritius.  Article 4, which we 
have already referred to, declares that the term resident of 
Mauritius' means any person who under the laws of Mauritius is 
'liable to taxation' therein by reason, inter alia, of his residence. 
Clause (2) of Article 4 enumerates detailed rules as to how the 
residential status of an individual resident in both contracting 
States has to be determined for the purposes of DTAC.  Clause(3) 
of Article 4 provides that if, after application of the detailed rules 
provided in Article 4, it is found that a person other than an 
individual is a resident of both the contracting States, then it shall 
be deemed to be a resident of the contracting State  in which its 
place of effective management is situated.  The DTAC requires the 
test of 'place of effective management' to be applied only for the 
purposes of the tie-breaker  clause in Article 4(3) which could be 
applied only when it is found that a person other than an individual 
is a resident both of  India  and Mauritius.  We see no purpose or 
justification in the DTAC for application of this test in any other 
situation.  



	Some of the assumptions underlying this contention, which 
prevailed with the High Court, need greater critical appraisal.
	Article 13(4) of the DTAC  provides that gains derived by a 
resident of a Contracting State from alienation of any property, 
other than those specified in the paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the 
Article, shall be taxable only in that State. Since most of the 
arguments centred around capital gains made on transactions in 
shares on the stock exchange in India, we may leave out of 
consideration capital gains on the type of properties contemplated 
in paras 1, 2 and 3 of Article 13 of the DTAC. The residuary clause 
in para 4 of Article 13 is relevant.  It provides that capital gains 
made on sale of shares shall be taxable only in the State of which 
the person is a 'resident' taking us back to the meaning of the term 
'resident' of a contracting State.  According to Article 4, this 
expression means any person who under the laws of that State is 
""liable to taxation"" therein by reason of his domicile, residence, 
place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.  
The terms 'resident of India' and 'resident of Mauritius' are 
required to be construed accordingly.  This takes us to the test to 
determine when a company is 'liable to taxation' in Mauritius. 



It is, therefore, not possible for us to accept the contentions 
so strenuously urged  on behalf of the respondents that avoidance 
of double taxation can arise only when tax is actually paid in one 
of the Contracting States.
The decision of Federal Court of Australia in Commissioner 
of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings  is illuminating.  The issue before 
the Federal Court was whether a Netherlands company was liable 
to income-tax under the Australian Income Tax Act on profits from 
the sale of shares in an Australian company and whether such 
profits fell within Article 13 (alienation of property) of the 
Netherlands-Australia Double Taxation Agreement, so as to be 
excluded from Article 7 (business profits) of that Agreement.  One  
Leonard Green, a principal of Leonard Green and Associates a 
limited partnership established in the United States, became aware 
of a potential investment opportunity in Australia. Arimco 
Resources and Mining Company NL ('Armico'), a company listed 
on the Australian Stock Exchange, which had a subsidiary  called 
Armico Mining Pty. Limited engaged in gold mining activities, 
was the subject of a hostile takeover bid, at a price which Green 
was advised  was less than the real value of the Armico. With this 
knowledge Green decided to mount a takeover offer for the 
subsidiary company. Then followed a series of steps of formation 
of a number of companies with interlocking share holdings where 
each company owned 1005 shares of a different subsidiary 
company.  Lamesa Holdings  was one such intermediary company 
of which 100% shares were held by Green Equity Investments Ltd.  
The share transactions brought about a profit to Lamesa Holdings 
which would be assessable to tax under the Australian Income Tax 
Act. Lamesa, however, relied on the provisions of the Article 13(2) 
of the Double Taxable Avoidance Convention ('DTAC') between 
Netherlands and Australia and claimed that the income was not 
taxable in Australia by reason thereof.  This income was wholly 
exempt from tax in Netherlands by  reason of the Income Tax Law 
applicable therein. The Federal Court found that  under Article
13(2) (a) (ii) of the DTAC shares in a company were treated as 
personalty, that since the place of incorporation of a company or 
the place of situs of a share may be the subject of choice,  the place 
of incorporation or the register upon which shares were registered 
would not form a particularly close connection with shares to 
ground the jurisdiction to tax share profits.  It was held:",

retrospective effect.  The majority however held that  after
the  coming  into force of the Constitution  the  effect  of
article 13(1) on such repugnant laws was that it  nullified
them,  and made them ineffectual and nugatory and devoid  of
any  legal force or binding effect.  It was further  pointed
out in one of the judgments representing the majority  view,
that the American rule that if a statute is repugnant to the
Constitution  the  statute is void from its  birth,  has  no
application  to	 cases concerning  obligations	incurred  or
rights	accrued in accordance with an existing law that	 was
constitutional	in  its inception, but that if any  law	 was
made  after the 26th January, 1950, which was  repugnant  to
the  Constitution,  then  the same rule	 shall	have  to  be
followed  in  India  as followed  in  America.	 The  result
therefore  of  this pronouncement is that the  part  of	 the
section of an existing law which is unconstitutional is	 not
law,  and is null and void.  For determining the rights	 and
obligations  of	 citizens the part declared void  should  be
notionally taken to be obliterated from the section for	 all
intents	 and purposes, though it may remain- written on	 the
statute	 book and be a good law when a question	 arises	 for
determination  of rights and obligations incurred  prior  to
26th January, 1950, and also for the determination of rights
of persons who have not been given fundamental rights by the
Constitution.	Thus, in this situation, there is  no  scope
for  introducing  terms like "" relatively void ""  coined  by
American  Judges in construing a Constitution which  is	 not
drawn  up in similar language and the implications of  which
are not quite familiar in this country."" The learned  Judge,
as  we	have already pointed out, rejected  the	 distinction
made  by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., between lack of	 legislative
power and the abridgment of the fundamental rights.   Though
that  question	did not directly arise,	 the  learned  Judge
expressed  his view on the scope of Art. 13(2) at  page	 653
thus:



""  The authority thus conferred by Articles 245 and  246  to
make  laws  subjectwise	 in the	 different  Legislatures  is
qualified by the declaration made in

the   prohibition  contained  in  article 13(2).   On	 the
construction  of  article 13(2) there was no  divergence  of
opinion	 between the majority and the minority	 in  Keshava
Madhava	 Menon v. The State of Bombay (supra).	It was	only
on  the	 construction of article 13(1) that  the  difference
arose  because	it  was felt that  that	 article  could	 not
retrospectively	  invalidate  laws  which  when	 made	were
constitutional according to the Constitution then in force.""

Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet of 
Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, ""



33.		In the earlier decision in Indra Sawhney Vs. Union of India 
[1992 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 454), B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the 
majority, while acknowledging that equality and equal opportunity is a basic 
feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant  position of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India in the scheme of things.  His Lordship 
stated:-

""6. The significance attached by the founding fathers to 
the right to equality is evident not only from the fact that 
they employed both the expressions 'equality before the 
law' and 'equal protection of the laws' in Article 14 but 
proceeded further to state the same rule in positive and 
affirmative terms in Articles 15 to 
18






Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment 
is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of 
our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the 
need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of 
the Constitution.  Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public 
employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold 
that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a 
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any 
right on the appointee.  If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment 
comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement or 
appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end 
when it is discontinued.  Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to 
be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment.  It has also to 
be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage 
worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would 
not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely 
on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not 
made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant 
rules.  It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the 
instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to 
an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, 
do not acquire any right.  High Courts acting under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, 
regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was 
made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.  Merely because, 
an employee had continued under cover of an order of Court, which we have 
described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of the judgment, he 
would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the 
service.  In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing 
interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it 
is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such 
a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an 
interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular 
procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an 
employee who is really not required.  The courts must be careful in ensuring 
that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its 
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments 
to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates.



39.		It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus 
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated.  It is 
stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them 
on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty 
long period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more 
wages or salaries for doing similar work.  The employees before us were 
engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on a wage that was 
made known to them.  There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not 
being paid.  Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by 
themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those 
who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.  No 
right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such 
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and 
made permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be 
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.  There is no fundamental 
right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on 
contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.  
As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, 
since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments 
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.  
The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily 
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who 
were regularly employed.  That would be treating unequals as equals.   It 
cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even 
though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment 
rules.  The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are 
therefore overruled.",
Article 14,"Ramana Dayaram Shetty vs The International Airport Authority Of ... on 4 May, 1979",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1281050/?formInput=Article%2014,,"This Court  accepted the  rule as  valid and  applicable  in
India in  A. S.	 Ahuwalia v.  Punjab(2)	 and  in  subsequent
decision given	in  Sukhdev  v.	 Bhagatram,(3)	Mathew,	 J.,
quoted	the   above-referred  observations  of	Mr.  Justice
Frankfurter with  approval. It	may be noted that this rule,
though supportable  also as  emanation from Article 14, does
not rest  merely on  that article.  It	has  an	 independent
existence  apart   from	 Article 14.	It   is	 a  rule  of
administrative law  which has  been judicially	evolved as a
check against  exercise of  arbitrary power by the executive
authority. If  we  turn	 to  the  judgment  of	Mr.  Justice
Frankfurter and	 examine it,  we find that he has not sought
to draw support for the rule from the equality clause of the
United States  Constitution, but evolved it purely as a rule
of administrative  law. Even in England, the recent trend in
administrative law  is in  that direction as is evident from
what  is   stated  at	pages	540-41	 in   Prof.   Wade's
Administrative Law  4th edition.  There is  no reason why we
should hesitate	 to  adopt  this  rule	as  a  part  of	 our
continually  expanding	administrative	law.  To-  day	with
tremendous  expansion	of  welfare   and   social   service
functions,  increasing	control	 of  material  and  economic
resources and  large  scale  assumption	 of  industrial	 and
commercial  activities	by  the	 State,	 the  power  of	 the
executive Government  to affect	 the lives  of the people is
steadily growing.  The attainment  of socio-economic justice
being a	 conscious end	of State policy, there is a vast and
inevitable increase  in the  frequency with  which  ordinary
citizens come  into relationship  of direct  encounter	with
State power-holders.  This renders it necessary to structure
and restrict  the power of the executive Government so as to
prevent its arbitrary application or
(1) 359 U. S. 535: 3 Law.Ed. (Second series) 1012
(2) [1975] 3. S. C. R. 82.



 This rule	also flows  directly from  the	doctrine  of
equality embodied  in Art.  14. It  is now well settled as a
result of  the decisions  of this  Court hl E. P. Rayappa v.
State cf  Tamil	 Nadu(l)  and  Maneka  Gandhi  v.  Union  of
India(2) that  Article 14  strikes at arbitrariness in State
action and  ensures fairness  and equality  of treatment. It
requires that State action must not be arbitrary but must be
based on  some rational and relevant principle which is non-
discriminatory: it  must not  be guided by any extraneous or
irrelevant considerations,  because that  would be denial of
equality. The  principle of  reasonableness and	 rationality
which is  legally as  well as  philosophically an  essential
element of  equality or	 non-arbitrariness is  protected  by
Article 14  and it  must characterise  every  State  action,
whether it  be under  authority of  law or  in	exercise  of
executive power	 without making	 of law.  The State  cannot,
therefore act  arbitrarily in  entering	 into  relationship,
contractual or	otherwise with a third party, but its action
must conform  to some standard or norm which is rational and
non-discriminatory. This   principle  was   recognised	 and
applied by a Bench of this Court presided over by Ray, C.J.,
in Erusian  Equipment and  Chemicals v. State of West Bengal
(supra) where  the learned  Chief Justice  pointed out	that
""the State  can carry  on executive function by making a law
or without  making a  law. The	exercise of  such powers and
functions in  trade by	the State  is subject to Part III of
the Constitution.  Article 14  speaks of equality before the
law  and   equal  protection   of  the	 laws.	Equality  of
opportunity should apply to matters of public contracts. The
State has  the right  to trade. The State has there the duty
to observe  equality. An  ordinary individual can choose not
to deal	 with any  person The  Government cannot  choose  to
exclude persons	 by  discrimination.  The  order  of  black-
listing has  the effect of depriving a person of equality of
opportunity in	the matter  of public contract. A person who
is on the approved list is unable to enter into advantageous
relations with	the  Government	 because  of  the  order  of
blacklisting.... A  citizen  has  a  right  to	claim  equal
treatment to  enter into  a contract  which may	 be  proper,
necessary and  essential to his lawful calling....It is true
that neither the petitioner nor the respondent has any right
to enter  into a  contract but	they are  entitled to  equal
treatment with others who offer tender or quotations for the
purchase of the
     (1) [1974] 2 S. C. R. 348.



     The Court	referred to  the offer	made by a well known
manufacturer of	 bidis for  purchase of	 the entire  crop of
kendu leaves for a sum of Rs. 3 crores which was turned down
by  the	 Government  and  expressed  its  surprise  that  no
explanation was attempted to be given on behalf of the State
as to  why such an offer, from which the State stood to gain
more than  Rs. 1  crore, was  rejected by the Government. It
will  be  seen	from  this  judgment  that  restricting	 the
invitation to  submit tenders  to a limited class of persons
was held to be violative of the equality clause, because the
classification	did   not  bear	 any.  just  and  reasonable
relation to  the  object  sought  to  be  achieved,  namely,
selling of  kendu leaves  in the interest of general public.
The standard  or  norm	laid  down  by	the  Government	 for
entering into  contracts of  sale of tendu leaves with third
parties was  discriminatory and could not stand the scrutiny
of Article 14 and  hence the scheme was held to be invalid.
The Court  rejected the contention of the Government that by
reason of  section 10  it was  entitled to  dispose of kendu
leaves in  such manner	as it  thought fit  and there was no
limitation upon	 its power  to enter into contracts for sale
of kendu  leaves with  such persons it liked. The Court held
that the  Government was,  in the  exercise of	its power to
enter into  contracts for  sale of  kendu leaves; subject to
the constitutional limitation of Article 14 and it could not
act arbitrarily in selecting persons with whom to enter into
contracts and discriminate against others similarly situate.
The Court criticised

the Government	for not	 giving any explanation as to why an
offer for  a large  amount was	not accepted,  the  clearest
implication being that the Government must act in the public
interest; it  cannot act  arbitrarily and without reason and
if it does so, its action would be liable to be invalidated.
This decision  wholly supports	the view  we are  taking  in
regard	to   The   applicability   of	the   rule   against
arbitrariness in State action. B
     We may also in this connection refer to the decision of
this Court  in C.  K. Achuthan	v. State of Kerala(1), where
Hidayatullah, J.,  speaking on	behalf	of  The	 Court	made
certain observation which was strongly relied upon on behalf
of the	respondents. The  facts of  this case  were that the
petitioner and	the 3rd	 respondent Co-operative Milk Supply
Union, Cannanore,  submitted tenders  for the supply of milk
to the	Government hospital  at Cannanore for the year 1948-



49. The	 Superintendent who scrutinised the tenders accepted
that of	 the petitioner and communicated the reasons for the
decision to  the Director  of Public  Health. The  resulting
contract  in   favour  of   the	 petitioner   was,  however,
subsequently cancelled	by issuing  a  notice  in  terms  of
clause (2)  of the tender, in pursuance of the policy of the
Government that	 in  the  matter  of  supply  to  Government
Medical Institutions  the  Co-operative	 Milk  Supply  Union
should be given contract on the basis of prices filed by the
Revenue Department.  The petitioner  challenged The decision
of the	Government in  a petition  under Article  32 of	 the
Constitution on	 the ground  inter alia	 that there had been
discrimination against	him vis-a-vis the 3rd respondent and
as such,  there was  contravention  of	Article 14  of	 the
Constitution.	The   Constitution   Bench   rejected	this
contention  of	 the  petitioner   and	 while	 doing	 so,
Hidayatullah, J.,  made the following observation: ""There is
no discrimination,  because it	is  perfectly  open  to	 the
Government, even  as it	 is to	a private party, to choose a
person to  their liking, to fulfil contracts which they wish
to be  performed. When	one person  is choosen	rather	than
another, the  aggrieved party cannot claim the protection of
Article 14,  because the  choice of  the person	 to fulfil a
particular contract  must be  left to  the Government.""	 The
respondents relied  very strongly  on  this  observation  in
support of  their contention  that it is open to the 'State'
to enter  into contract	 with any  one it likes and choosing
one person  in preference  to another  for entering  into  a
contract does  not involve  violation of  Article 1a. Though
the language  in which this observation is couched is rather
wide, we  do not  think that in making this observation, the
Court.	intended   to  lay  down  any  absolute	 proposition
permitting the	state to  act arbitrarily  in the  matter of

This assumes importance in view of the plea of Shri Divan that the

impugned judgments should be set aside on the ground that when

the arbitral awards did not provide for solatium or interest, no

Section 34 petition having been filed by the landowners on this

score, the Division Bench judgments that are impugned before us

ought not to have allowed solatium and/or interest. Ordinarily, we

would have acceded to this plea, but given the fact that the

Government itself is of the view that solatium and interest should be

granted even in cases that arise between 1997 and 2015, in the

interest of justice we decline to interfere with such orders, given our

discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of

India. We therefore declare that the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act relating to solatium and interest contained in Section

23(1A) and (2) and interest payable in terms of section 28 proviso

will apply to acquisitions made under the National Highways Act.

Consequently, the provision of Section 3J is, to this extent, violative

of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, declared to

be unconstitutional. Accordingly, Appeal @ SLP (C) No. 9599/2019

is dismissed.",

The  judgment  of A. N. RAY, C. J. D. G. PALEKAR and  Y.  V.
CHANDRACHUD  J.J. was delivered by Chandrachud,	 J.  KRISHNA
IYER, J.  delivered a separate concerning Opinion on  behalf
of Bhagwati.  J. and	 himself.
CHANDRACHUD, J. If persons  drawn from different sources are
integrated  into  one  class, can they'	 be  classified	 for
purposes  of  promotion on the basis  of  their	 educational
qualifications?	 That is the issue for consideration  before
us.
Respondents,  who are Diploma Holders in Engineering,  filed
in  the	 High Court of Jammu and Kashmir  a  petition  under
article 226 of the Constitution to challenge the validity of
certain Service Rules framed by the Government of Jammu	 and
Kashmir.  A Learned single Judge dismissed the petition	 but
in  appeal a Division Bench of the High Court took the	view
that the impugned rules were violative of articles 14 and 16
of  the	 Constitution.	 The correctness  of  that  view  is



The  case of the respondents as disclosed in their  petition
was that under the, rules of 1939, Assistant Engineers	were
entitled to be promoted to the higher cadre on the basis  of
their  merit and record and no distinction was made  between
degree-holders and diploma holders for the purposes of	such
promotion.   The discrimination made by the  impugned  rules
between degree-holders and diploma-holders was arbitrary and
capricious because academic or technical qualifica-
7 77
tions could be germane only at the time of recruitment.	 For
purposes of promotion, efficiency and experience alone	must
count.	  Respondents  further	contended  that	  once	 the
Government  appointed candidates with different academic  or
technical qualifications to the same cadre, having the same,
pay scale and similar duties, such candidates would form one
class and they cannot be further classified for purposes  of
promotion on the basis of their educational  qualifications.
The,  impugned rules, according to the respondents,  brought
about	a  reduction  in  rank,	 deprived  them	  of   equal
opportunity in the matter of promotion and were violative of
articles 14 and 16 of the constitution of India.   Finally,
the respondents contended by their petition that it was	 not
competent to the Government to change the service conditions
unilaterally- to the disadvantage of its employees so as  to
deprive	 them of their vested right of promotion  by  giving
retrospective effect to the rules.



Most of the arguments advanced for the respondents have been
considered  and rejected by this Court in some case  or	 the
other  but before coming to that, a few points may, be	kept
out of way.
An  argument which found favour with Mufti Bahauddin  J.,one
of  the	 learned Judges of the Letters Patent Bench  of	 the
High  Court,  and which was repeated before us is  that	 the
""retrospective""	  application  of  the	impugned  rules	  is
violative  of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. It  is
difficult  to  appreciate this argument	 and  impossible  to
accept	it. It is wrong to characterise the operation  of  a
service rule   as  retrospective  for  the  reason  that  it
applies to existing employees. A rule which classifies	such
employees for promotional purposes, undoubtedly operates  on
those who entered service before the framing of	  the	rule
but it operates in future, in the sense that it governs	 the
future	right  of  promotion of those  who  are	 already  in
service. The   impugned	 rules	do not	recall	a  promotion
already made or reduce a pay-scale  already  granted.	They
provide,  for a classification by prescribing a	 qualitative
standard,  the	measure of that standard  being	 educational
attainment.  Whether  a	 classification founded	 on  such  a
consideration suffers from a discriminatory vice is  another
matter	  which	 we will presently consider but surely,	 the
rule cannot first be	 assumed  to  be  retrospective	 and
then  be  struck down for the reason that  it  violates	 the
guarantee  of equal opportunity by extending its  arms	over
the  past. If rules governing conditions of  service  cannot
ever operate  to the prejudice of those who are	 already  in
service,  the  age of superannuation  should  have  remained
immutable and schemes of compulsory  retirement	 in   public
interest ought to have foundered on	the	rock	  of
retroactivity.	 But  such  is,	 not  the   implication	  of
'servicerules  nor is it their true description to say	that
because they affect I	 existing    employees	 they	 are
retrospective. It is well-settled that though	  employment
under the Government like that under any other master  may
have a contractual origin, the Government servant acquires a
status'	 on  appointment  to his office. As  a	result,	 his
rights and obliga-



   This argument, as presented, is attractive but it assumes
in  the	 court a right of scrutiny somewhat  wider  than  is
generally recognized.  Article 16 of the Constitution  which
ensures	 to all citizens equality of opportunity in  matters
relating to employment is but an instance or incident of the
guarantee of equality contained in article 14.	The  concept
of   equal  opportunity	 undoubtedly  permeates	 the   whole
spectrum  of  an individual's  employment  from	 appointment
through promotion and termination to the payment of gratuity
and  pension.  But the concept of equality has	an  inherent
limitation   arising   from   the   very   nature   of	 the
constitutional guarantee.  Equality is for equals.  That  is
to  say	 that  those who  are  similarly  circumstanced	 are
entitled to an equal treatment.",
Article 14,"Maneka Gandhi vs Union Of India on 25 January, 1978",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1766147/?formInput=Article%2014,,"In order to apply the tests contained in Articles 14 and  19

judges	of this Court in Khudiram Das v. The State  of	West
Bengal	 &  Ors.(1)  Interestingly,  even  prior  to   these
decisions, as pointed out by Dr. Rajive Dhawan, in his	book
: ""The Supreme Court of India :"" at page 235, reference	 was
made,  by this court in Mohd.  Sabir v. State of  Jammu	 and
Kashmir(2)  to article 191(2) to justify preventive;  deten-
tion.	The  law, must, therefore, now be taken to  be	well
settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19 and that
even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving
a person of 'personal liberty' and there is consequently  no
infringement  of the fundamental right conferred by  Article
21,  such  law, in so far as it abridges or takes  away	 any
fundamental  right under Article 19 would have to  meet	 the
challenge  of that article. This proposition can no  longer
be  disputed  after the decisions in R.	 C.  Cooper's  case,
Shambhu	 Nath Sarkar's case and Haradhan Saha's case.	Now,
if  a  law  depriving a person	of  'personal  liberty'	 and
prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the  meaning
of  Article 21 has to stand the test of one or more  of	 the
fundamental  rights conferred under Article 19 which may  be
applicable  in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must	also
be  liable to be tested with reference to Article 14. This
was in fact not disputed by the learned Attorney General and
indeed	he  could  not	do  so in  view	 of  the  clear	 and
categorical  statement	made  by Mukharjea,  J.,  in  A.  K.
Gopalan's case that Article 21 ""presupposes that the law  is
a  valid  and  binding	law  under  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution   having  regard  to  the	competence  of	 the
legislature  and  the  subject it relates to  and  does	 not
infringe   any	 of  the  fundamental	rights	 which	 the
Constitution  provides	for"", including	 Article 14. This
Court  also  applied  Article 14  in  two  of	its  earlier
decisions,  namely,  The State of West Bengal v.  Anwar	 Ali
Sarkar(3)   and	  Kathi	 Raning	 Rawat	v.  The	  State	  of
Saurashtra(4)  where there was a special law  providing	 for
trial  of certain offences by a speedier process which	took
away  some of the safeguards available to an  accused  under
the ordinary procedure in the Criminal Procedure Code. The
special	 law  in each of these two cases  undoubtedly  pres-
cribed	a procedure for trial of the specified offences	 and
this  procedure could not be condemned as inherently  unfair
or unjust and there was thus compliance with the requirement
of Article 21, but even so, the validity of the special	 law
was  tested before the Supreme, Court on the  touchstone  of
Article 14  and in one case, namely, Kathi  Raning  Rawat's
case,  the  validity was upheld and in	the  other,  namely,
Anwar Ali Sarkar's case, it was struck down.  It was held in
both  these  cases  that the procedure	established  by	 the
special	 law must not be violative of the  equality  clause.
That procedure must answer the requirement of Article 14.
The  nature and requirement of the procedure  under  article



21.
Now,  the  question  immediately arises as to  what  is	 the
requirement of Article 14 : what is the content and reach of
the great equalising principle enunciated in this article  ?
There  can  be no doubt that it is a founding faith  of	 the
Constitution.  It is indeed the pillar on which

rests  securely the foundation of our  democratic  republic.
And,  therefore,  it  must not be  subjected  to  a  narrow,
pedantic  or lexicographic approach._ No attempt  should  be
made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for, to
do so would be to violate its activist magnitude.   Equality
is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it
cannot	be  imprisoned Within  traditional  and	 doctrinaire
limits.	 We must reiterate here what was pointed out by	 the
majority  in E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu &  Another
(1)  namely,  that  ""from  a  positivistic  point  of  view,
equality  is antithetic to arbitrariness.  In fact  equality
and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule
of  law	 in  a republic, while the other, to  the  whim	 and
caprice of an absolute monarch.	 Where an act is  arbitrary,
it  is implicit in it that it is unequal both  according  to
political  logic  and constitutional law  and  is  therefore
violative  of  Article 14"". Article 14	 strikes,  at  arbi-
trariness in State action and ensures fairness and  equality
of  treatment.	 The  principle	 of  reasonableness,   which
legally as well as philosophically, is an essential  element
of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like  a
brooding  omnipresence	and the	 procedure  contemplated  by
Article	 21 must answer the best of reasonableness in  order
to be in conformity with Article 14.  It must be ""'right and
just  and fair"" and not arbitrary, fanciful  or	 oppressive;
otherwise,  it	would  be  no  procedure  at  all  and	 the
requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.
How  far  natural  justice  is	air  essential	element	  of
procedure established by law.



	      2.The  representation  of	 the  petitioner
	      will be dealt with expeditiously in accordance
	      with law.
This  statement removes the voice from the order  impounding
the passport and it can no longer be assailed on the  ground
that it does not comply with the audi alteram partem rule or
is.  not  in  accord with the procedure	 prescribed  by	 the
Passports Act, 1967.
Is Section 10(3) (c) violative of Article 14 ?
That takes us to the next question whether section 10(3) (c)
is  violative  of any of the fundamental  rights  guaranteed
under  Part III of the Constitution.  Only two	articles  of
the  Constitution are relied upon for this purpose and	they
are  Articles 14  and 19 (1) (a) and (g).   We	 will  first
dispose of the challenge based on Article 14 as it lies in a
very  narrow  compass.	 The argument tinder  this  head  of
challenge, was that

section	 10(3) (c) confers unguided and unfettered power  on
the Passport Authority to impound a passport and hence it is
violative  of the equality clause contained in	Article 14.
It  was conceded that under section 10 (3) (c) the power  to
impound a passport can be exercised only upon one or more of
the,  stated grounds, but the complaint was that the  ground
of  ""interests	of the general public"". was  too  vague	 and
indefinite  to	afford	any real guidance  to  the  Passport
Authority  and the Passport Authority could, without in	 any
way violating the terms of the section, impound the passport
of one and not of another, at its discretion.  Moreover,  it
was  said that when the order impounding a passport is	made
by  the Central Government, there is no appeal	or  revision
provided  by  the Statute and the decision  of	the  Central
Government  that  it  is in public  interest  to  impound  a
passport is final and conclusive.  The discretion vested  in
the  Passport  Authority, and particularly  in	the  Central
Government, is thus unfettered and unrestricted and this  is
plainly	 in violation of Article 14.  Now, the law  is	well
settled that when a statute vests unguided and	unrestricted
power  in  an  authority to affect the rights  of  a  person
without	 laying	 down any policy or principle  which  is  to
guide  the authority in exercise of this power, it would  be
affected by the vice of discrimination since it would  leave
it open to the Authority to discriminate between persons and
things similarly situated.  But here it is difficult to	 say
that  the discretion conferred on the Passport Authority  is
arbitrary or unfettered.  There are four grounds set out  in
section 10(3) (c) which would justify the making of an order
impounding a passport.	We are concerned only with the	last
ground denoted by the words ""in the interests of the general
public"",  for that is the ground which is attacked as  vague
and indefinite.	 We fail to see how this ground can, by	 any
stretch of argument, be characterised as vague or undefined.
The  words ""in the interests of the general public""  have  a
clearly well defined meaning and the courts have often	been
called upon to decide whether a particular action is ""in the
interests of the general public"" or in ""public interest"" and
no difficulty has been experienced by the Courts in carrying
out  this  exercise.   These  words  are  in  fact  borrowed
ipsissima verba from Article 19(5) and we think it would  be
nothing short of heresy to accuse the constitution makers of
vague  and  loose  thinking.  The  legislature	performed  a
scissor	 and paste operation in lifting these words  out  of
Article 19(5) and introducing them in section 10(3) (c)	 and
if  these  words  are not vague and  indefinite	 in  Article
19(5),	it is difficult to see bow they can be condemned  to
be  such  when	they occur in section 10(3)  (c).   How	 can
section	 10(3)	(c)  be said  to  incur	 any  constitutional
infirmity  on account of these words when they are no  wider
than  the  constitutional  provision in	 Article  19(5)	 and
adhere	loyally	 to  the  verbal  formula  adopted  In	 the
Constitution  ? We are clearly of the view  that  sufficient
guidelines  are provided by the, words ""in the interests  of
the general public"" and the power conferred on the  Passport
Authority  to  impound	a  passport cannot  be	said  to  be
unguided  or  unfettered.  Moreover, it must  be  remembered
that the exercise of this power is not made dependent on the
subjective opinion of the Passport Authority as regards	 the
necessity  of  exercising it on one or more of	the  grounds
stated	in  the	 section,  but	the  Passport  Authority  is
required to record in writing a brief statement of reasons
for impounding the passport and, save in cer-",
Article 14,"Union Of India And Another vs Tulsiram Patel And Others on 11 July, 1985",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1134697/?formInput=Article%2014,,"Article 14 and the Second Proviso
     The next  question which  false to	 be  considered	 is,
""Does Article 14 make	any difference	to the	consequences
which flow  from the  second proviso  to Article 311(2)?"" It
was submitted  on behalf  of the  government  servants	that
Article 14  in which  the principle  of natural	 justice are
comprehended  permeates	  the	entire	 Constitution	and,
therefore, Article 14 must  be read into the second proviso
to Article  311(2) and	according if  not under that proviso
read by	 itself, under	it read with Article 14 a government
servant is  entitled to an opportunity both of showing cause
against the  charges made  against him	as also	 against the
penalty	 proposed  to  be  imposed  upon  him,	though	such
opportunity may	 not extend to the holding of a complete and
elaborate inquiry  as would  be the case where clause (2) of
Article 311  applies. According	 to learned  Counsel this is
what is	 required by  the audi	alteram partem rule which is
one of	the two	 main principles  of natural Justice. In the
alternative it	was submitted  that though  an order  may be
valid and  supportable under  the second  proviso to Article
311(2), it  could none	the less be void under Article 14 on
the ground  that the principles of natural justice have been
wholly	disregarded.  These  arguments	are  based  upon  an
imperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice
in their application in courts of law to the adjudication of
causes before  them and the function of Article 14 vis-a-vis
the other  provisions of  the Constitution  and particularly
the second proviso to Article 311(2).



 Article 14	 contains a guarantee of equality before the
law  to	 all  persons  and  a  protection  to  them  against
discrimination by  any law.  Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of
Article 13 defines law as follows:
	  ""'law' includes  any	Ordinance,  order,  bye-law,
	  rule, regulation,  notification, custom  or  usage
	  having in  the territory  of India  the  force  of
	  law"".
What Article 14 forbids  is discrimination by law, that is,
treating  persons  similarly  circumstanced  differently  or
treating those	not similarly  circumstanced in the same way
or, as has been pithily put, treating equals as unequals and
unequals   as	equals.	  Article 14	 prohibits   hostile
classification by law and is directed against discriminatory
class legislation. The propositions deducible from decisions
of this court on this point have

been set  out in  the form  of thirteen	 propositions in the
judgment of  Chandrachud, C.J.,	 in In Re The Special Courts
Bill, 1978.  The first of these propositions which describes
the nature of the two parts of Article 14 has been extracted
earlier. We  are not  concerned in  these Appeals  and	Writ
Petitions with	the  other  propositions  set  out  in	that
judgment. In  early days,  this	 Court	was  concerned	with
discriminatory and  hostile class  legislation and it was to
this aspect  of Article 14 that its attention was directed.
As fresh thinking began to take place on the scope an anoint
of Article 14, new dimensions to this guarantee of equality
before the  law and  of the  equal protection  of  the	laws
emerged and  were recognized  by this Court. It was realized
that to treat one person differently from another when there
was no	rational basis	for doing  so would be arbitrary act
thus discriminatory.  Arbitrariness can	 take many forms and
shapes but  whatever form  or shape it takes, it is none the
less discrimination. It also became apparent that to treat a
persons or a class of persons unfairly would be an arbitrary
act amounting  to discrimination  forbidden by	Article 14.
Similarly, this	 Court, recognized that to treat a person in
violation of  the principles of natural justice would amount
to arbitrary  and discriminatory treatment and would violate
the guarantee given by Article 14.



	  ""Article 14  is the  genus while  Article 16	is a
	  species, Article  16 gives  effect to the doctrine
	  of equality  in all  matters	relating  to  public
	  employment. The  basic principle which, therefore,
	  informs both	Articles 14  and 16  is equality and
	  inhibition against  discrimination. Now,  what  is
	  the content  and reach  of this  great  equalizing
	  principle? It is a founding

	  faith, to  use the  words of	Bose, J.,  'a way of
	  life', and  it must  not be  subjected to a narrow
	  pedantic  or	lexicographic  approach.  We  cannot
	  countenance  any  attempt  to	 truncate  its	all-
	  embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be
	  to violate  its activist  magnitude. Equality is a
	  dynamic concept  with many  aspects and dimensions
	  and it  cannot be  'cribbed, cabined and confined'
	  within traditional  and doctrinaire limits. From a
	  positivistic point of view, equality is qutithetic
	  to   arbitrariness.	 In   fact    equality	 and
	  arbitrariness are  sworn enemies;  one belongs  to
	  the rule  of law in a republic while the other, to
	  the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where
	  an act  is arbitrary	it is implicit in it that it
	  is unequal  both according  to political logic and
	  constitutional law  and is  therefore violative of
	  Article 14,  and if it effects any matter relating
	  to public  employment, it  is	 also  violative  of
	  Article  16. Article 14   and  16	 strike	  at
	  arbitrariness in  State action and ensure fairness
	  and equality of treatment. They require that State
	  action must be based on valent relevant principles
	  applicable alike  to all  similarly situate and it
	  must not be guided by any extraneous or Irrelevant
	  coordinations because	 that  would  be  denial  of
	  equality. Where  the operative  reason  for  State
	  action, as distinguished from motive inducing from
	  the antechamber of the mind, is not legitimate and
	  relevant but is extraneous and outside the area of
	  permissible considerations,  it  would  amount  of
	  mala fide  exercise of  power and  that is  hit by
	  Articles 14  and 16.	Mala fide  exercise of power
	  and arbitrariness  are different lethal radiations
	  emanating from  the same vice : in fact the latter
	  comprehends the  former.  Both  are  inhibited  by
	  Articles 14 and 16."" (Emphasis supplied)

The question in Gopalan's case and Cooper's case was whether
particular Articles guaranting certain Fundamental Rights

operated exclusively  without having any inter-relation with
any other Article in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. This
is not	the question  before us.  Neither Article  19 or  21
excludes the  operation of the other Articles in Part III of
the  Constitution. Where  however,   an  Article   in	 the
Constitution expressly	excludes the  application of certain
Fundamental Rights,  the view taken in Cooper's case and the
other cases  which followed it, namely, that the Articles in
the  Chapter   on  Fundamental	Rights	do  not	 operate  in
isolation, cannot  apply. Article  13  invalidates  any	 law
which violates any of the Fundamental Rights. Article 31A(1)
provides that ""Notwithstanding anything contained in article
13, no law providing for ..... shall be deemed to be void on
the ground  that it  is inconsistent  with, or takes away or
abridges any  of the  rights conferred	by  article 14	 and
article 19"".  Under  Article  31B,  none  of  the  Acts	 and
Regulations  specified	 in  the   Ninth  schedule   to	 the
Constitution nor  any of  the provisions  thereof are  to be
deemed to be void on the ground that such Act, Regulation or
provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any
of the	rights conferred  by any  provisions  of  Part	III.
Article	 31C   provides	  that	 ""Notwithstanding   anything
contained in  Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy
of the	State towards  securing .  . . shall be deemed to be
void on	 the ground  that it  is inconsistent with, or takes
away or	 abridges any  of the rights conferred by article 14
or article  19 .  . . "". Gan it then be contended in face of
these express  provisions in  the Constitution that none the
less Article 14 will  apply to	 the  provisions  of  a	 law
specified in  Article 31A(1)  or 31B  or 31C?  Clause(2)  of
Article 311  is an  express statement of what the right of a
fair hearing  guaranteed by  Article 14 would require and by
the opening  words of the second proviso to that clause that
right is  expressly taken away, and R.C.Cooper's case cannot
be invoked  to reintroduce  that right on the ground that it
flows by  implication from  Article 14. If the contention of
the petitioner	that in	 all cases  there must be a right of
hearing before an order is made to a person's prejudice were
correct, the  result would  be startling  and anomalous. For
instance inspite  of Article  21 & 22 no person can be taken
in preventive  detention unless	 he has	 been first given an
opportunity of	showing cause  against the  proposed action.
Results such as these would make a mockery of the provisions
of the Constitution.",

28. Soon after the enforcement of the Constitution two cases reached this Court from the State of Madras - one under Article 15 and the other under Article 16. Both the cases were decided on the same date and by the same Bench. The one arising under Article 15 is State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan [1951] S.C.R. 525, and the other arising under Article 16 is Venkataraman v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 229. By virtue of certain orders issued prior to coming into force of the Constitution,-popularly known as 'Communal G.O.' - seats in the Medical and Engineering Colleges in the State of Madras were apportioned in the following manner: Non-Brahmin (Hindus)-6, Backward Hindus-2, Brahmin-2, Harijan-2, Anglo Indians and Indian Christians-1, Muslims-1. Even after the advent of the Constitution, the G.O. was being acted upon which was challenged by Smt. Champakam as violative of the fundamental rights guranteed to her by Articles 15(1) and 29(2) of the Constitution of India. A Full Bench of Madras High Court declared the said G.O. as void and un-enforceable with the advent of the Constitution. The State of Madras brought the matter in appeal to this Court. A Special Bench of Seven Judges heard the matter and came to the unanimous conclusion that the allocation of seats in the manner aforesaid is violative of Articles 15(1) and 29(2) inasmuch as the refusal to admit the respondent (writ petitioner) notwithstanding her higher marks, was based only on the ground of caste. The State of Madras sought to sustain the G.O. with reference to Article 46 of the Constitution. Indeed the argument was that Article 46 over-rides Article 29(2). This argument was rejected. The Court pointed out that while in the case of employment under the State, Clause (4) of Article 16 provides for reservations in favour of backward class of citizens, no such provision was made in Article 15.



35. During the years 1968 to 1971, this Court had to consider the validity of identification of backward classes made by Madras and Andhra Pradesh Governments. Minor P.Rajendran v. State of Madras related to specification of socially and educationally backward classes with reference to castes. The question was whether such an identification infringes Article 15. Wanchoo, CJ., speaking for the Constitution Bench dealt with the contention in the following words:

The contention is that the list of socially and educationally backward classes for whom reservation is made under Rule 5 nothing but a list of certain castes. Therefrore, reservation in favour of certain castes based only on caste considerations violates Article 15(1), which prohibits discrimination on the ground of caste only. Now if the reservation in question had been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational backwardness of the caste in question, it would be violative of Article 15(1). But it must not be forgotten that a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as a whole is socially and educationally backward reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the ground that it is a socially and educationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of Article 15(4).... It is true that in the present cases the list of socially and educationally backward classes has been specified by caste. But that does not necessarily mean that caste was the sole consideration and that person belonging to these castes are also not a class of socially and educationally backward citizens.... As it was found that members of these castes as a whole were educationally and socially backward, the list which had been coming on from as far back as 1906 was finally adopted for purposes of Article 15(4)
 
 

In view however of the explanation given by the State of Madras, which has not been controverted by and rejoinder, it must be accepted that though the list shows certain castes, the members of those castes are really classes of educationally and socially backward citizens. No attempt was made on behalf of the petitioners/appellant to show that any caste mentioned in this list was not educationally and socially backward. In this state of the pleadings, we must come to the conclusion that though the list is prepared caste-wise, the castes included therein are as a whole educationally and socially backward and therefore the list is not violative of Article 15. The challenge to Rule 5 must therefore fail.



 Broadly stated, neither caste nor race nor religion can be made the basis of classification for the purposes of determining social and educational backwardness within the meaning of Article 15(4). When Article 15(1) forbids discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, caste cannot be made one of the criteria for determining social and educational backwardness. If caste or religion is recognised as a criterion of social and educational backwardness Article 15(4) will stultify Article 15(1). It is true that Article 15(1) forbids discrimination only on the ground of religion, race, caste but when a classification taken recourse to caste as one of the criteria in determining socially and educationally backward classes the expression ""classes"" in that case violates the rule of expressio unions est exclusio alterius. The socially and educationally backward classes of citizens are groups other than groups based on caste.



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.",

Article 15,"Prathvi Raj Chauhan vs Union Of India on 10 February, 2020",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/31336209/?formInput=Article%2015,,"47. The Constitution of India provides equality before the law under
the provisions contained in Article 14. Article 15(4) of the Constitution
carves out an exception for making any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens or SCs. and STs. Further protection is conferred under Article
15(5) concerning their admission to educational institutions, including
private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State,
other than the minority educational institutions. Historically
disadvantageous groups must be given special protection and help so that
they can be uplifted from their poverty and low social status as observed
in Kailas & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, 2011 (1) SCC 793. The
legislature has to attempt such incumbents be protected under Article
15(4), to deal with them with more rigorous provisions as compared to
provisions of general law available to the others would create inequality
which is not permissible/envisaged constitutionally. It would be an action
to negate mandatory constitutional provisions not supported by the
constitutional scheme; rather, it would be against the mandated
constitutional protection. It is not open to the legislature to put members
of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a disadvantageous
position vis-à-vis others and in particular to so-called upper
castes/general category. Thus, they cannot be discriminated against more
so when we have a peep into the background perspective. What
legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative
process by the courts.



3.       It is this idea of India, - a promise of oneness of and for, all people, regardless of
caste, gender, place of birth, religion and other divisions that Part III articulates in four
salient provisions: Article 15, Article 17, Article 23 and Article 24. The idea of fraternity
occupying as crucial a place in the scheme of our nation’s consciousness and polity, is
one of the lesser explored areas in the constitutional discourse of this court. The
fraternity assured by the Preamble is not merely a declaration of a ritual handshake or
cordiality between communities that are diverse and have occupied different spaces: it is
far more. This idea finds articulation in Article 15. 1 That provision, perhaps even more
than Article 14, fleshes out the concept of equality by prohibiting discrimination and
discriminatory practices peculiar to Indian society. At the center of this idea, is that all
people, regardless of caste backgrounds, should have access to certain amenities,
services and goods so necessary for every individual. Article 15 is an important
guarantee against discrimination. What is immediately noticeable is that whereas Article
15 (1) enjoins the State (with all its various manifestations, per Article 12) not to
discriminate on the proscribed grounds (religion, race, caste, sex (i.e. gender), place of
birth or any of them), Article 15 (2) is a wider injunction: it prohibits discrimination or
subjection to any disability of anyone on the grounds of religion, caste, race, sex or place
of birth in regard to access to shops, places of public entertainment, or public restaurants

1    The relevant parts of Article 15 are extracted below:



         (b)      the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly
             out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public…”
     (3)          Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and
         children”
(Article 15 (2) (a)). Article 15(2)(b) proscribes the subjection of anyone to any disability
on the proscribed grounds (i.e. discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, race, sex or
place of birth) with regard to “the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of
public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of
the general public..”





11.      In a similar vein, the court in Nandini Sundar v. State of Chhatisgarh6 again
commented on this aspect and said that “t(T)he Constitution itself, in no uncertain
terms, demands that the State shall strive, incessantly and consistently, to promote
fraternity amongst all citizens such that dignity of every citizen is protected, nourished
and promoted.”
12.      It was to achieve this ideal of fraternity, that the three provisions- Articles 15, 17
and 24 were engrafted. Though Article 17 proscribes the practice of untouchability and
pernicious practices associated with it, the Constitution expected Parliament and the
5     1993 (1) SCR 480
6     2011 (7) SCC 457
legislatures to enact effective measures to root it out, as well as all other direct and
indirect, (but virulent nevertheless) forms of caste discrimination. Therefore, in my
opinion, fraternity is as important a facet of the promise of our freedoms as personal
liberty and equality is. The first attempt by Parliament to achieve that end was the
enactment of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955. The Act contained a significant
provision that where any of the forbidden practices “is committed in relation to a
member of a Scheduled Caste” the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is proved,
that such act was committed on the ground of “Untouchability”. This implied that the
burden of proof lies on the accused and not on the prosecution. The Protection of Civil
Rights Act, 1955, followed. This too made provision for prescribing “punishment for the
preaching and practice of - ""Untouchability"" for the enforcement of any disability
arising therefrom”. The enforcement of social practices associated with untouchability
and disabilities was outlawed and made the subject matter of penalties. After nearly 35
years’ experience, it was felt that the 1955 Act (which was amended in 1976) did not
provide sufficient deterrence to social practices, which continued unabated and in a
widespread manner, treating members of the scheduled caste and tribe communities in
the most discriminatory manner, in most instances, stigmatizing them in public places,
virtually denying them the essential humanity which all members of Society are entitled
to.",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles 15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article 15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article 15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article 15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article 15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



45.    As   regards   exemption   of   minority   educational   institutions   in 


Article 15(5), it was contended that this was done to conform with the  


Constitutional   mandate   of   additional   protection   for   minorities   under 


Article 30.   It was argued that Article 15(5) does not override Article
15(4).     They   have   to   be   read   together   as   supplementary   to   each 


other   and   Article 15(5)   being   an   additional   provision,   there   is   no  


conflict between Article 15(4) and Article 15(5). Article 15(4), 15(5), 


29(2),   30(1),   and   30(2)   all   together   constitute   a   Code   in   relation   to 


admission to educational institutions.  They have to be harmoniously  


construed in the light of the Preamble and Part IV of the Constitution. 



60. Shri  G.E.   Vahanvati,   learned  Solicitor  General of   India  appearing  



on behalf of the Union of India, submitted that the argument of Shri 


Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel that the American doctrine of 


""strict scrutiny"" should be applied to the affirmative action envisaged 


under Article 15(5) is not correct.   It was  argued that the impugned 


legislation is not  ex facie  discriminatory and, therefore, it cannot be 


classified as a ""suspect legislation"". It was argued that right that from  


the case of                     T

reasoning   was   followed   in  M.R.   Balaji   &   Others    Vs.    State   of 


Mysore20  by   a   five   Judge   Bench. Thereafter,   the   same   view

Subba Rao. J. (as he then was) said that ""the expression `nothing in  


this article'   is a legislative device to express its intention in a most  


emphatic way that the power conferred there under is not limited in  


any way by the main provision but falls outside it"" . The view that 


Articles 15(4)   and   16(4)   are   exceptions   to   Article 15(1)   and   16(1)  


respectively   was   again   reiterated   in  Triloki   Nath  Vs.    State   of 


Jammu   &   Kashmir   &   Ors.   (II)22    and   in  The   State   of   Andhra 


Pradesh & Ors.     Vs.   U.S.V. Balram, Etc23. The learned Solicitor 


General further pointed out that in  State of Kerala & Anr.  Vs   N.M. 


Thomas & Ors.24   the majority opinion held that Articles 14, 15 and  


16   are   parts   of   the   scheme   of   equality   and   that   Articles 15(4)   and  


16(4) are not exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively. The  


said change in  N.M. Thomas's case  (supra) was noticed by Justice 


Chinnappa   Reddy   in  K.C.   Vasanth   Kumar   &   Anr.      Vs.    State   of 


Karnataka25    and   the   same   view   was   upheld   in  Indra   Sawhney's 


case   (supra).     The   learned   Solicitor   General   further   contended   that 


once it is accepted that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are not exceptions to  


Articles 15(1)   and   16(1)   respectively,   then   there   is   no   question   of

treating the social welfare measure as being `facially discriminatory'  


or  ""ex facie""  violative of the rule of equality.  It was argued that it is  


not simply a matter of legal equality.  De jure equality must ultimately 


find its  raison d'etre  in  de facto  equality.   The State must, therefore, 


resort   to   compensatory   State   action   for   the   purpose   of   uplifting 


people who are factually unequal in their wealth, education or social  


environment. Relying on the observations of Subba Rao, J. in        T. 


Devadasan's case (supra), it was argued that centuries of calculated 


oppression   and   habitual   submission   has   reduced   a   considerable 


section of our community to a life of serfdom and it would be well nigh 


impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of equal opportunity 


was   strictly   enforced   in   their   case   and   they   would   not   have   any 


change   if   they   were   made   to   enter   the   open   field   of   competition 


without adventitious aids till such time when they could stand on their  


own   legs. Laying   reliance   on   the   observations   made   in  N.M. 


Thomas's case (supra) and also in  Indra Sawhney's case (supra), 


the   learned   Solicitor   General   argued   that   under   Articles 15(4)   and 


16(4) the State is obliged to remove inequalities and backwardness 


from society. It was further submitted that the American doctrine of  


""strict scrutiny"" had been expressly rejected by this Court in Saurabh 


Chaudri   &   Ors.    Vs.      Union   of   India   &   Ors.26      As   regards 


identification   of   backward   classes,   the   learned   Solicitor   General  


contended   that   while   dealing   with   the   aspect   of   identification   of 


backwardness   for   socially   and   educationally   backward   classes,   it 


cannot   be   denied   that   there   is   backwardness   in   this   country;   that 


large sections of the country are socially and educationally backward;



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article 15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article 15(5)   would   include   Article 15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.",
Article 15,"Kailash Chand Sharma vs State Of Rajasthan & Ors on 30 July, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/312106/?formInput=Article%2015,,"There can be little doubt that the impugned circular is the product of
the policy decision taken by the State Government.  Even then, as rightly
pointed out by the High Court, such decision has to pass the test of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution.	If the policy decision, which in the present
case has the undoubted effect of deviating from the normal and salutary rule
of selection based on merit is subversive of the doctrine of equality, it cannot
sustain.  It should be free from the vice of arbitrariness and conform to the
well-settled norms  both positive and negative underlying Articles 14 and
16, which together with Article 15 form part of the Constitutional code of
equality.



	In order to justify the preferential treatment accorded to residents of
the district  and the  rural areas of the district in the matter of selection to the
posts of teachers, the State has come forward with certain pleas either before
the High Court or before this Court.   Some of these pleas are pressed into
service by the learned counsel appearing for the parties who are the possible
beneficiaries under the impugned order of the Govt. Such pleas taken by the
State Government and from which support is sought to be drawn by the
individual parties concerned will be referred to a little later.
Before proceeding further we should steer clear of a misconception
that surfaced in the course of arguments advanced on behalf of the State and
some of the parties.  Based on the decisions which countenanced
geographical classification for certain weighty reasons such as socio-
economic backwardness of the area for the purpose of admissions to
professional colleges, it has been suggested that residence within a district or
rural areas of that district could be a valid basis for classification for the
purpose of public employment as well.  We have no doubt that such a
sweeping argument which has the overtones of parochialism is liable to be
rejected on the plain terms of Article 16(2) and in the light of Art. 16(3).  An
argument of this nature flies in the face of the peremptory language of
Article 16 (2) and runs counter to our constitutional ethos  founded on unity
and integrity of the nation.  Attempts to prefer candidates of a local area in
the State were nipped in the bud by this Court since long past.	 We would
like to reiterate that residence by itself  be it be within a State, region,
district or lesser area within a district cannot be a ground to accord
preferential treatment or reservation, save as provided in Article 16(3). It is
not possible to compartmentalize the State into Districts with a view to offer
employment to the residents of that District on a preferential basis.  At this
juncture it is appropriate to undertake a brief analysis of Article 16.
Article 16 which under clause (1)  guarantees equality of
opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment
to any office under the State reinforces that guarantee by prohibiting under
clause (2) discrimination on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex,
descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.  Be it noted that in the
allied Article Article 15, the word 'residence' is omitted from the opening
clause prohibiting discrimination on specified grounds.	 Clauses (3) and (4)
of Article 16 dilutes the rigour of clause (2) by  (i) conferring an enabling
power on the Parliament to make a law prescribing the residential
requirement within the State in regard to a class or classes of employment or
appointment to an office under the State and (ii) by enabling the State to
make a provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of
any backward class of citizens which is not adequately represented in the
services under the State.  The newly introduced clauses (4-A) and (4-B),
apart from clause (5) of Article 16 are the other provisions by which the
embargo laid down in Article 16 (2) in somewhat absolute terms is lifted to
meet certain specific situations with a view to promote the overall objective
underlying the Article. Here, we should make note of two things: firstly,
discrimination only on the ground of residence (or place of birth) in so far as
public employment is concerned is prohibited; secondly, Parliament is
empowered to make the law prescribing residential requirement within a
State or Union Territory, as the case may be, in relation to a class or classes
of employment.	That means, in the absence of parliamentary law, even the
prescription of requirement as to residence within the State is a taboo.
Coming to the first aspect, it must be noticed that the prohibitory mandate
under Article 16(2) is not attracted if the alleged discrimination is on
grounds not merely related to residence,  but  the factum of residence is only
taken into account in addition to other relevant factors.  This, in effect, is the
import of the expression 'only'.



The lack of material to establish nexus between the geographical
classification and the object sought to be achieved  thereby was thus held to
be violative of Article 14.
 The question which fell for consideration of this Court  whether the
action of the State in Pradip Tandon vs. State of U.P. (1975 (1) SCC 267)
was  in reserving certain percentage of seats available in medical colleges in
favour of candidates from rural areas, hill areas and Uttarakhand was
justified?  The reservation was sought to be justified from the stand point of
Article 15(4).	Repelling the contention, Ray, C.J., speaking  for a three-
Judge Bench observed that ""the Constitution does not enable the State to
bring socially and educationally backward areas within the protection of
Article 15(4)"".	 It was pointed out that the accent in Article 15(4) is on
classes of citizens :



	Though the Court was primarily dealing with an argument based on
Article 15(4) and the import of the expression ""socially and educationally
backward classes of citizens"" occurring in that sub-Article, the observations
quoted above are quite relevant in testing the plea raised on behalf of the
State to save the classification. In the face of what has been laid down in
Pradip Tandon's case, the State cannot possibly invoke Article 16(4).
Our attention has however been drawn to the following observations
in Nidamarti's case (supra) in reiteration of what was said in Pradeep Jain's
case (supra) :",

Article 2,"Union Of India And Another vs Tulsiram Patel And Others on 11 July, 1985",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1134697/?formInput=Article%202,,"Clauses (1)  and (2) of Article 311 impose restrictions
upon the  exercise by  the President  or the  Governor of  a
State of  his  pleasure	 under	Article	 310(1).  These	 are
express provisions with respect to termination of service by
dismissal or  removal as  also with  respect to reduction in
rank of	 a civil  servant and  thus come within the ambit of
the  expression	  ""Except  as  expressly  provided  by	this
Constitution"" qualifying Article 310(1). Article 311 is thus
an exception  to Article 310 and was described in Parshottam
Lal Dhingra  v. Union  of India,  [1958] S.C.R.	 820,829, as
operating as a proviso to Article 310(1) though set out in a
separate Article.  Article 309	is,  however,  not  such  an
exception. It  does not lay down any express provision which
would  derogate	 from  the  amplitude  of  the	exercise  of
pleasure under	Article 310(1).	 It merely  confers upon the
appropriate Legislature	 or executive the power to make laws
and frame  rules but  this power  is  made  subject  to	 the
provisions of the Constitution. Thus, Article 309 is subject
to Article 310(1) and any provision restricting the exercise
of the	pleasure of  the President  or Governor in an Act or
rule made  or frame  under Article  309 not being an express
provision  of  the  Constitution,  cannot  fall	 within	 the
expression   ""Except   as   expressly	provided   by	this
Constitution"" occurring	 in Article  310(1) and	 would be in
conflict  with	Article	 310(1)	 and  must  be	held  to  be
unconstitutional.  Clauses   (1)  and  (2)  of	Article	 311
expressly restrict  the manner in which a Government servant
can be	dismissed, removed  or reduced in rank and unless an
Act made  or rule  framed under Article 309 also conforms to
these restrictions, it would be void. The restriction placed
by clauses  (1) and  (2) of  Article 311  are two : (1) with
respect to  the authority  empowered to	 dismiss or remove a
government servant  provided for  in clause  (1) of  Article
311; and  (2)  with  respect  to  the  procedure  dismissal,
removal	 or  reduction	in  rank  of  a	 government  servant
provided for  in clause(2).  The second	 priviso to  Article
311(2), which  is the  central point of controversy in these
Appeals and Writ Petitions, lifts the restriction imposed by
Article 311(2)	in the	cases specified in the three clauses
of that proviso.



 Article 14 and the Second Proviso
     The next  question which  false to	 be  considered	 is,
""Does Article  14 make	any difference	to the	consequences
which flow  from the  second proviso  to Article 311(2)?"" It
was submitted  on behalf  of the  government  servants	that
Article 14  in which  the principle  of natural	 justice are
comprehended  permeates	  the	entire	 Constitution	and,
therefore, Article  14 must  be read into the second proviso
to Article  311(2) and	according if  not under that proviso
read by	 itself, under	it read with Article 14 a government
servant is  entitled to an opportunity both of showing cause
against the  charges made  against him	as also	 against the
penalty	 proposed  to  be  imposed  upon  him,	though	such
opportunity may	 not extend to the holding of a complete and
elaborate inquiry  as would  be the case where clause (2) of
Article 311  applies. According	 to learned  Counsel this is
what is	 required by  the audi	alteram partem rule which is
one of	the two	 main principles  of natural Justice. In the
alternative it	was submitted  that though  an order  may be
valid and  supportable under  the second  proviso to Article
311(2), it  could none	the less be void under Article 14 on
the ground  that the principles of natural justice have been
wholly	disregarded.  These  arguments	are  based  upon  an
imperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice
in their application in courts of law to the adjudication of
causes before  them and the function of Article 14 vis-a-vis
the other  provisions of  the Constitution  and particularly
the second proviso to Article 311(2).



 The rule of natural justice with which we are concerned
in these  Appeals  and	Writ  Petitions,  namely,  the	audi
alteram partem	rule, in  its fullest amplitude means that a
person against	whom an order to his prejudice may be passed
should be  informed of	the allegations	 and charges against
him, be	 given an  opportunity of submitting his explanation
thereto, have  the right  to know the evidence, both oral or
documentary, by	 which the  matter is proposed to be decided
against him,  and to  inspect the documents which are relied
upon for  the purpose of being used against him, to have the
witnesses who  are to  give evidence against him examined in
his presence  and have	the right to cross-examine them, and
to lead	 his own evidence, both oral and documentary, in his
defence. The  process of  a fair  hearing need not, however,
conform to  the judicial  process in a court of law, because
judicial  adjudication	 of  causes  involves  a  number  of
technical  rules   of  procedure   and	evidence  which	 are
unnecessary and	 not required  for the	purpose	 of  a	fair
hearing within	the meaning of audi alteram partem rule in a
quasi-judicial or  administrative inquiry.  If	we  look  at
clause (2)  of Article	311 in	the light  of what is stated
above, it will be apparent that	 clause is merely an express
statement  of	the  audi   alteram  partem  rule  which  is
implicitly made	 part of  the guarantee contained in Article
14 as  a result	 of  the  interpretation  placed  upon	that
Article by  recent decisions  of this  Court. Clauses (2) of
Article 311  requires that  before a  government servant  is
dismissed, removed  or reduced	in rank,  an inquiry must be
held in	 which he is informed of the charges against him and
given a	 reasonable opportunity of being heard in respect of
those charges.	The nature  of the  hearing to be given to a
government servant under clauses (2) of Article 311 has been
elaborately set	 out by	 this Court  in Khem chand's case in
the passages  from the judgment extracted above. Though that
case related  to the original clause (2) of Article 311, the
same applies to the present clause (2) of Article 311 except
for the	 fact that  now a government servant has no right to
make any  representation against  the penalty proposed to be
imposed upon him but, as pointed out earlier, in the case of
Suresh Koshy  George v. The University of Kerala and others,
such an opportunity is not the requirement of the principles
of  natural   justice  and  as	held  in  Associated  Cement
Companies Ltd.	v. T.  C. Shrivastava and others neither the
ordinary law of the land nor industrial law requires such an
opportunity to be given. The

Opportunity of	showing cause  against the  proposed penalty
was only  the result  of the  interpretation placed  by	 the
Judicial Committee  of the Privy Council in Lall's Case upon
section 240(3)	of the	Government of India, 1935, which was
accepted by  this Court in Khem Chand's Case. If, therefore,
an inquiry  held against  a government	servant under clause
(2) of Article 311 is unfair or biased or has been conducted
in such	 a manner  as not  to give  him a fair or reasonable
opportunity to	defend himself,	 undoubtedly, the principles
of natural justice would be violated, but in such a case the
order of  dismissal, removal  or reduction  in rank would be
held to	 be bad	 as contravening  the express  provisions of
clause (2)  of Article	311 and	 there will  be no scope for
having	recourse   to  Article	 14  for   the	purpose	  of
invalidating it.



 (Emphasis supplied.)
     Not only,	therefore, can	the  principles	 of  natural
justice be  modified but  in exceptional cases they can even
be excluded.  There are	 well-defined exceptions to the nemo
judex in  causa sua  rule as also to the audi alteram partem
rule. The  nemo judex  in causa	 sua rule  is subject to the
doctrine of  necessity and  yields to  it as  pointed out by
this Court  in J.Mohapatra  & Co.  and another	v. State  of
Orissa and  another [1985] 1 S.C.R. 322,334-5. So far as the
audi alteram  partem rule  is concerned, both in England and
in India,  it is  well established  that where	a right to a
prior notice  and an opportunity to be heard before an order
is passed would obstruct the taking of prompt action, such a

right can be excluded. This right can also be excluded where
the nature of the action to be taken, its object and purpose
and the	 scheme of the relevant statutory provisions warrant
its exclusion;	nor can	 the audi  alteram  partem  rule  be
invoked if  importing it would have the effect of paralysing
the administrative process or where the need for promptitude
or the	urgency of  taking action so demands, as pointed out
in Maneka Gandhi's  case at page 681. If legislation and the
necessities of	a situation  can exclude  the principles  of
natural justice	 including the	audi alteram  partem rule, a
fortiorari so  can a  provision or  the Constitution,  for a
Constitutional provision has a far greater and all-pervading
sanctity than  a statutory  provision. In  the present case,
clause (2)  of Article	311 is	expressly  excluded  by	 the
opening words  of the  second proviso  and particularly	 its
key-words this clause shall not apply. As pointed out above,
clause (2) of Article 311 embodies in express words the audi
alteram partem	rule.  This  principle	of  natural  justice
having	been   expressly  excluded   by	  a   Constitutional
provision, namely,  the second	proviso	 to  clause  (2)  of
Article 311,  there is	no scope  for reintroducing  it by a
side-door to  provide once  again the same inquiry which the
Constitutional provision  has expressly	 prohibited. Where a
clause of  the second  proviso is  applied on  an extraneous
ground or  a ground  having no	relation  to  the  situation
envisaged in that clause, the action in so applying it would
be mala	 fide, and,  therefore, void.  In such	a  case	 the
invalidating factor may be referable to Article 14. This is,
however, the  only  scope  which  Article  14  can  have  in
relation to  the second	 proviso. but  to hold that once the
second proviso is properly applied and clause (2) of Article
311 excluded,  Article 14  will step in to take the place of
clause (2)  would be  to nullify  the effect  of the opening
words of the second proviso and thus frustrate the intention
of the	makers of  the Constitution.  The second  proviso is
based on  public policy	 and is	 in public  interest and for
public good and the Constitution - makers who inserted it in
Article 311(2)	were the best persons to decide whether such
an exclusionary provision should be there and the situations
in which this provision should apply.",
Article 2,Constitution of India,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/237570/,,,
Article 2,"The State Of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singhof ... on 27 May, 1952",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/41868/?formInput=Article%202,,"(ii) was a ""provision"" of article 31 (2), submitted that (i)
was  not.   According to him clause (2)assumed but  did	 not
""provide""  that acquisition should be authorised only for  a
public	purpose.  I cannot accept that view. In my  opinion,
the  clause seeks also to impose a limitation in  regard  to
public	purpose.   The clause was evidently worded  in	that
form  as it was copied (with minor variations) from  section
299  (2)  of the Government of India Act,  1935,  which	 was
undoubtedly designed to give effect to the recommendation of
the  Joint  Parliamentary Committee in para.  369  of  their
Report	that two conditions should be imposed on  expropria-
tion  of  private  property:  ""We think	 it  (the  provision
proposed)  should secure that legislation  expropriating  or
authorising  the  expropriation of the property	 of  private
individuals should be lawful only if confined to  expropria-
tion  for public purpose and if compensation  is  determined
either in the first instance or in appeal by some  independ-
ent  authority"". It is thus clear that section 299  (2)	 was
intended  to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject  to
which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private
property  should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to	con-
clude  that  article 31 (2) was also intended to impose	 the
same  two  conditions on legislation  expropriating  private
property.    In	 other	words, article 31 (2)must be  under-
stood as also providing that legislation authorising  expro-
priation of private property should be lawful only if it was
required  for  a public purpose and provision was  made	 for
payment of compensation.  Indeed if this were not so,  there
would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent	 acquisition
for  a non-public or private purpose and without payment  of
compensation--an  absurd result. It cannot be supposed	that
the  framers of	 the Constitution, while expressly  enacting
one of the two well-established restrictions on the exercise
of the right of eminent domain, left the other to be import-
ed  from the common law.  Article 81 (2) must therefore,  be
taken to provide for both the limitations in express  terms.
An attack on the

ground of contravention of these provisions implies that the
law in question authorises acquisition without reference  to
a public purpose and without payment of compensation.	This
was  precisely the objection raised both by Mr. Das and	 Dr.
Ambedkar  to  the constitutional validity  of  the  impugned
statutes, and such objection really amounts to calling those
laws  in  question on the ground that they  contravened	 the
provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel stoutly
denied	that they were relying on the provisions of  article
31(2).	 The denial, however, seems to me to be based  on  a
quibbling  distinction	without a difference  in  substance.
Their  main  attack was really grounded on  the	 absence  of
these  two  essential  prerequisites  of  valid	 legislation
authorising acquisition of private property, though Mr.	 Das
would  deduce them by implication from entry 36 of  List  II
and  entry  42	of List III, while Dr.	Ambedkar  sought  to
derive	them from the spirit of the Constitution.  But	this
is only a form of stating the objection which, in substance,
is  that  the statutes are bad because of the absence  of  a
public	purpose and the omission to provide for a just	com-
pensation.   This, in fact, was the burden of  the  argument
before us. If, then, these two grounds of attack fall within
the  purview  of article 31(4), the  words  ""notwithstanding
anything  in  this  Constitution"" are apt  to  exclude	such
grounds howsoever they are derived--whether from the entries
in the legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-
tion-for  both alike are covered by those words. Indeed,  if
the  objection based on the absence of a public purpose	 and
of a provision for just compensation were still to be  open,
clause	(4) of article 31  would be meaningless	 surplusage.
It  is	obvious that that clause was specially	designed  to
protect	 the  impugned	statutes and  other  laws  similarly
enacted	 from  attack  in a court of law  on  the  aforesaid
grounds	 and, if they were nevertheless to be considered  as
not being within the protection, it is difficult to see what
the  use of article 31 (4) would be.  Learned  counsel	were
unable to suggest any.	The fact is that article 31 (4) was

designed  to  bar the jurisdiction of  courts  to  entertain
objections to the validity of a certain class of  enactments
on  the	 two-fold ground referred to above,  and  its  whole
purpose	 would stand  defeated if the zemindars'  contention
were to prevail.



    That  the obligation to provide for compensation is	 not
included in the content of the legislative power under entry
36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List	III,
will be made further clear when we come to consider  closely
clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and article 31-A.  Article
31(4)  protects a law of the description  mentioned  therein
against the provisions of article 31(2). It follows,  there-
fore,  that what is sought to be protected by article  31(4)
is a law for the acquisition or taking possession of proper-
ty which does not, amongst other things, provide for compen-
sation or

does  not fix the amount or specify the principles on  which
and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined
and given, for otherwise there would be no necessity for any
protection.  The question at once arises as to whether there
is  any legislative entry in List 11 under which a  law	 for
acquisition or taking possession of property without compen-
sation	can  be made by a State Legislature.   To  test	 the
validity of Mr. P.R. Das's argument and to avoid the compli-
cation	arising	 out of the residuary powers  of  Parliament
under  article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken	 the
case  of a law of acquisition made by the legislatures of  a
State  which  also come within article 31  (4).	  Is  there,
then,  any entry in List II under which a State	 Legislature
can  make  a  law for acquisition  without  compensation  or
public purpose ? Obviously there is none, except entry 36 in
List  II.  If that entry by itself or read with entry 42  in
List  III has any implication as suggested, namely,  that  a
law for acquisition of property-made under entry 36 in	List
II  without a provision for compensation will be beyond	 the
legislative   competency  of the  State	 Legislatures,	then
there  is no other entry under which such a law can be	made
by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, be no point
in  making  a  provision in article  81(4)  for	 protecting,
against	 article  31(2), a law which,  on  this	 hypothesis.
cannot be made at all. Article 81(4) postulates a law  which
offends against 31 (2) and so far as the State	Legislatures
are  concerned there is no entry in List II except entry  36
under  which such an offending law may be made by the  State
Legislatures.  This  circumstance  unmistakably	 establishes
that entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with-entry 42 in
List III, has not any such implication as is imputed to	 it.
Likewise  take	article 81 (5) (b) (ii) which  protects	 the
provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make for
the  promotion of public health or the prevention of  danger
to  life  or property.	The law which is thus sought  to  be
protected must also involve acquisition of property  without
any  provision for compensation, for otherwise there can  be
no occasion or necessity for

any protection against article 31 (2).	A law of this  kind,
in so far as such law provides for acquisition of  property,
must necessarily be made by a State Legislature. if at	all,
under  entry 36 in List II.  If Mr. P.R.  Das's	 contentions
were  correct,	a  law for the promotion of  health  or	 the
prevention  of	danger	to life or  property  involving	 the
acquisition  of property without a provision  for  compensa-
tion,  which is what is sought to be protected from  article
31 (2), can never be made, for the obligation to provide for
compensation  is, according to him, implicit in	 entry36  in
List  II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List  III,	 and
there  is no other entry under which a law may be made by  a
State  Legislature with respect to acquisition of  property.
It is futile to attempt to get over this anomaly by suggest-
ing  that  clauses (4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article  31	have
been inserted in the Constitution ex abundanti cautela, for,
if Mr. P.R. Das were correct in his submission, no amount of
caution was necessary for protecting a law that, ex  hypoth-
esi, cannot be made at all. Similar arguments may as well be
founded	 on article 31-A, for that article also	 protects  a
law from article 31 (2) which is in Part III of the  Consti-
tution. It is suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid
law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of	 its
legislative  powers. If a State Legislature in making a	 law
for  the acquisition of property for a public purpose  under
entry 36 in List II must provide for compensation then a law
made  conformably  with this supposed  requirement  of	that
entry  by a State Legislature will require no protection  at
all against article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-
ed as meaningless and unnecessary.   Surely, that conclusion
is  manifestly	untenable.  In my opinion  clauses  (4)	 and
(5)(b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A clearly  negative
Mr. P.R. Das's proposition.  In my judgment, for the reasons
stated	above, the  major premise in the arguments  advanced
by  Mr.	 P.R. Das under 'the first head,  namely,  that	 the
obligation  to pay compensation is implicit in entry  36  in
Lis  II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III  is	 un-
sound.



    Assuming  that the obligation to pay compensation  which
is  expressly provided in article 31(2) is also implicit  in
entry 36 in List II by itself or read with entry 42 in	List
III, the respondents cannot. even then, be permitted to call
in  question the validity of the impugned Act on the  ground
that  it  does not provide for compensation, for  then	they
will  be  doing	 exactly what they are forbidden  to  do  by
article	 31 (4) and the newly added  articles.	Article31(4)
and the added articles debar the respondents from  question-
ing the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia,	that
it  contravenes	 or is inconsistent with or  takes  away  or
abridges  any of the rights conferred by the  provisions  of
clause (2) of article 31.  The emphasis in those articles is
rather on the ""provisions"" than on the number of the article
or the Part of the Constitution. It is obvious that the real
substance  of  the matter is that articles 31(4),  31-A	 and
31-B  expressly seek to prevent a challenge to the  validity
of the Act based on the ground, inter alia, that it does not
provide	 for  compensation. This obligation to	provide	 for
compensation is no doubt one of the provisions of article 31
(2)  but  if  as contended by Mr. P.R. Das,  the  self	same
provision be found elsewhere in the same Constitution, e.g.,
entry  36  in  List II or entry 42 in List  III,  then	that
""provision"" must also be regarded as having been covered  by
article	 31(4)	and the two added  articles,  for  otherwise
those articles will be rendered nugatory.  In my opinion, if
two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt	that
which

will  implement	 and discard that which	 will  stultify	 the
apparent  intention  of	 the  makers  of  the  Constitution.
Further, it must be borne in mind that article 31 (4)  which
applies	 ""notwithstanding  anything in	this  Constitution"",
will,  by force of the very words, protect the	Act  against
even  legislative incompetency, if any, arising out  of	 the
alleged noncompliance with the suggested implied provisions,
if any, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III.  In
my  judgment the respondents are not, by reason of  articles
31(4),	31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act in  question
on  the	 ground that it does not provide  for  compensation,
whether	 the ground is formulated as a breach of article  31
(2) or of the implied provision, if any, of the	 legislative
heads mentioned above.



    It	will  be noticed that the argument that the  Act  is
unconstitutional  is founded on the assumption that  it	 has
not laid down any principle for determining compensation  as
required by entry 42 in List III and that the provision	 for
compensation is wholly illusory. Chapter V of the Act  deals
with assessment of compensation.  Shortly put, the scheme is
to start with the gross assets which are taken to be synony-
mous  with the gross income and then to make certain  deduc-
tions  therefrom and to arrive at the net assets.  Then	 the
compensation is to be calculated at a sliding scale of rates
varying from 20 to 3 times of the net income. To the  amount
thus  determined is to be added a moiety of the	 accumulated
arrrears of rent etc. and the compensation for the mines and
minerals as determined under section 25. Ex facie, it cannot
be disputed that the Act does prescribe some principles	 for
determining  the compensation payable to the  proprietor  or
tenure-holder.	It is, however, pointed out that the  deduc-
tion of 5 to 20 per cent. of the gross assets as and by	 way
of  cost of management is quite arbitrary. It is  said	that
although  it  is well known that the percentage of  cost  of
management  in relation to the income of a small  estate  is
greater	 than that of a larger estate, yet the Act  provides
for deducting 20 percent. of the gross assets in the case of
proprietors

of  the larger estates but only 5 per cent. in	the case  of
the smaller estates.  Objection is next taken to the  deduc-
tion  of  any amount under the head of works of	 benefit  to
raiyats the and also to the scale of such deduction.   These
arguments,  to my mind, do not on close scrutiny, amount  to
saying	that  the Act does not lay down	 any  principle	 for
determining the compensation.  The real underlying  implica-
tion  of these arguments, as I understand them, is that	 the
principles  are not good enough in that they do not  produce
fair compensation.  I do not think the Court can go into the
policy of the legislation.  All that the Court is  concerned
with  is to see whether any principle has been laid down  as
mentioned  in  entry  42 in List III. It is  true  that	 the
percentage of costs of management calculated on the basis of
the  income of a big estate is less than that of  a  smaller
estate,	 but  it is quite clear that the Act has  fixed	 the
scale  of  deduction under this head and under the  head  of
works of benefit according to the capacity of the proprietor
or  tenureholder to bear it.  It is impossible to  say	that
the  provision	for deduction for works of  benefit  to	 the
raiyats	 is  not supported by any principle. A	landlord  is
expected to spend money on works of benefit to his  raiyats,
e.g.,  providing  tanks and  wells,  irrigation,  charitable
dispensary,  schools  and  so forth and be it  said  to	 the
credit	of  some of the landlords that in practice  they  do
spend  money  on this account. Therefore, there	 is  nothing
wrong,	when  calculating the net income of a  landlord,  to
deduct	something  which the' landlords should and  some  of
them often do, in practice, spend under this head.  I see no
absence of principle in this provision.	 The rate of  deduc-
tion, I have said, has been fixed according to the  capacity
of  the proprietors or tenure-holders.	It has	been  shown.
and it is not denied that in many cases a calculation of the
net  income on the basis of the principles laid down in	 the
Act operates to reduce the gross income to a very small	 net
income.	 To take only one instance, the gross annual  income
of  the	 Darbhanga  estate  is	about  Rs.  47,85,069,	 the
deduction

allowed by the Act is about Rs. 44.88,585 and the net income
computed  according to the principles laid down in  the	 Act
comes  to about Rs. 2,96,484 or say Rs. 3 lacs and the	com-
pensation  payable to  the Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga	will
be only rupees 9 lacs.	It has also been shown that at least
in  one	 case, e.g., in the case of the Raja of	 Purnea	 the
compensation calculated according to the principle laid down
in  the Act works out at a deficit figure. The fact that  in
one isolated case the calculation may work out in this	way,
does  not,  however, prove that no principle has  been	laid
down. Indeed, in all other cases the principle laid down  in
the  Act actually produces compensation, however  inadequate
it may be said to be in some cases. If a principle has	been
laid  down, then the provisions of entry 42 in List III	 are
amply satisfied and no question of legislative	incompetency
can arise. If a principle has been laid down in the Act	 but
that principle does not in fact produce any compensation  in
any  rare case or adequate compensation in some	 cases	then
the real complaint should be, not that no principle has been
laid down but, that the principle laid down does not produce
what  may  be  called just compensation.   That	 result	 may
offend against the provisions of article 31 (2) but certain-
ly not against entry 42 in List III and in view of  articles
31 (4), 31-A and 31-B the Act cannot be challenged for	non-
compliance with article 31 (2).	 On the other hand, even  if
it is held that no principle has, in fact, been laid down by
the Act, as contended, then that fact not only amounts to  a
breach	of the provisions of entry 42 in List III  but	also
constitues  a  breach of the provisions of  article  31	 (2)
which  clearly and emphatically requires the law  to  either
fix the compensation or lay down the principles on which and
the  manner in which the compensation is to be given  and  a
breach	of this ""provision"", call it a provision of  article
31(2)  or one of entry 42 in List III. cannot.	for  reasons
already	 stated,  be questioned in view of  articles  31(4),",

15. In an early judgment of this Court, M.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish

   Chandra 1954 SCR 1077, an eight-Judge Bench of this Court set out

   Article 20(3), and then went into the historical origin of this Article in

   English law. In an important passage, the Court held:
         “In view of the above background, there is no inherent
         reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as
         comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate
         to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words
         used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when
         appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberally
         construed, so as to advance the intendment thereof and


to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which
this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be
said to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right
pertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a
protection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It
is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his
giving evidence “against himself”.”
                                            (at page 1086)

Broadly stated the guarantee in Article 20(3) is against
“testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is
confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial
for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can
see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional
guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would
be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to
miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain
American decisions. The phrase used in Article 20(3) is
“to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely
by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents
or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb
witness (See Section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like.
“To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish
evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through
the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in
other modes. So far as production of documents is
concerned, no doubt Section 139 of the Evidence Act
says that a person producing a document on summons is
not a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the
right of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the
connotation of the word “witness”, which must be
understood in its natural sense i.e. as referring to a
person who furnishes evidence. Indeed, every positive
volitional act, which furnishes evidence is testimony, and
testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures
the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as
opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission
on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the
protection in respect of the evidence so procured is
confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.
The phrase used in Article 20(3) is “to be a witness” and
not to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection


         afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the
         phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of
         testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well
         extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from
         him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a
         formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence
         has been levelled which in the normal course may result
         in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in
         other situations does not call for decision in this case.
         Considered in this light, the guarantee under Article 20(3)
         would be available in the present cases to these
         petitioners against whom a first information report has
         been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to any
         compulsory     process       for production of   evidentiary
         documents which are reasonably likely to support a
         prosecution against them.



 20. We now come to the judgment of this Court in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L.

   Dani (1978) 2 SCC 424. This case referred to the inter-play between

   Article 20(3) and section 161 of the CrPC as follows:
        “21. Back to the constitutional quintessence invigorating
        the ban on self-incrimination. The area covered by Article
        20(3) and Section 161(2) is substantially the same. So
        much so, we are inclined to the view, terminological
        expansion apart, that Section 161(2) of the CrPC is a
        parliamentary gloss on the constitutional clause. The
        learned Advocate-General argued that Article 20(3), unlike
        Section 161(1), did not operate at the anterior stages
        before the case came to court and the accused's
        incriminating utterance, previously recorded, was
        attempted to be introduced. He relied on some passages
        in American decisions but, in our understanding, those
        passages do not so circumscribe and, on the other hand,
        the landmark Miranda [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436
        (1966)] ruling did extend the embargo to police
        investigation also. Moreover, Article 20(3), which is our
        provision, warrants no such truncation. Such a narrow
        meaning may emasculate a necessary protection. There
        are only two primary queries involved in this clause that
        seals the lips into permissible silence: (i) Is the person
        called upon to testify “accused of any offence”? (ii) Is he
        being compelled to be witness against himself? A
        constitutional provision receives its full semantic range
        and so it follows that a wider connotation must be
        imparted to the expressions “accused of any offence” and
        “to be witness against himself”. The learned Advocate-



        General, influenced by American decisions rightly agreed
        that in expression Section 161(2) of the Code might cover
        not merely accusations already registered in police
        stations but those which are likely to be the basis for
        exposing a person to a criminal charge. Indeed, this wider
        construction, if applicable to Article 20(3), approximates
        the constitutional clause to the explicit statement of the
        prohibition in Section 161(2). This latter provision
        meaningfully uses the expression “expose himself to a
        criminal charge”. Obviously, these words mean, not only
        cases where the person is already exposed to a criminal


charge but also instances which will imminently expose
him to criminal charges. In Article 20(3), the expression
“accused of any offence” must mean formally accused in
praesenti not in futuro — not even imminently as
decisions now stand. The expression “to be witness
against himself” means more than the court process. Any
giving of evidence, any furnishing of information, if likely to
have an incriminating impact, answers the description of
being witness against oneself. Not being limited to the
forensic stage by express words in Article 20(3), we have
to construe the expression to apply to every stage where
furnishing of information and collection of materials takes
place. That is to say, even the investigation at the police
level is embraced by Article 20(3). This is precisely what
Section 161(2) means. That sub-section relates to oral
examination by police officers and grants immunity at that
stage. Briefly, the Constitution and the Code are co-
terminus in the protective area. While the Code may be
changed, the Constitution is more enduring. Therefore, we
have to base our conclusion not merely upon Section
161(2) but on the more fundamental protection, although
equal in ambit, contained in Article 20(3).

57. We hold that Section 161 enables the police to
examine the accused during investigation. The prohibitive
sweep of Article 20(3) goes back to the stage of police
interrogation — not, as contended, commencing in court
only. In our judgment, the provisions of Article 20(3) and
Section 161(1) substantially cover the same area, so far
as police investigations are concerned. The ban on self-
accusation and the right to silence, while one investigation
or trial is under way, goes beyond that case and protects
the accused in regard to other offences pending or
imminent, which may deter him from voluntary disclosure
of criminatory matter. We are disposed to read “compelled
testimony” as evidence procured not merely by physical
threats or violence but by psychic torture, atmospheric
pressure, environmental coercion, tiring interrogative
prolixity, overbearing and intimidatory methods and the
like — not legal penalty for violation. So, the legal perils
following upon refusal to answer, or answer truthfully,


cannot be regarded as compulsion within the meaning of
Article 20(3). The prospect of prosecution may lead to
legal tension in the exercise of a constitutional right, but
then, a stance of silence is running a calculated risk. On
the other hand, if there is any mode of pressure, subtle or
crude, mental or physical, direct or indirect, but sufficiently
substantial, applied by the policeman for obtaining
information from an accused strongly suggestive of guilt, it
becomes “compelled testimony”, violative of Article 20(3).",

Our  Constitution  embodies generally the  Parliamentart  or
Cabinet	 system of Government of the British model both	 for
the Union and the States.  Under this system the,  President
is  the	 Constitutional or formal head of the Union  and  he
exercises  his powers and functions conferred on him  by  or
under the Constitution on the aid and advice of his  Council
of  Ministers  Article 103 is an exception to  the  aid	 and
advice of the Council of- Ministers because it	specifically
provides  that	the  President acts only  according  to	 the
opinion	 of  the  Election Commission.	 This  is  when	 any
question  arises as to whether a member of either  House  of
Parliament   has   become  subject  to	any  of	  the	dis-
qualifications mentioned in clause (1) of Article 102.
Under  the Cabinet system of Government as embodied  in	 our
Constitution  the Governor is the constitutional  or  formal
head  of  the  State and be exercises  all  his	 powers	 and
functions  conferred on him by or under the Constitution  on
the  aid  and  advice of his Council of	 Ministers  save  in
spheres	 where	the  Governor is required by  or  under	 the
Constitution to exercise his functions in his discretion.
The  executive power is generally described as	the  residue
which  does  not  fall within the  legislative	or  judicial
power.	But executive power may also partake of	 legislative
or  judicial  actions.	 All powers  and  functions  of	 the
President  except his legislative powers as for	 example  in
Article 123 viz., ordinance making power and all powers	 and
functions  of the Governor except his legislative  power  as
for example in Article 213 being ordinance making powers are
executive powers of the Union vested in the President  under
Article 5 3 ( 1) in one case and are executive powers of the
State  vested  in the Governor under Article `54(1)  in	 the
other  case.  Clause (2) or Clause (3) of Article 77 is	 not
limited	 in  its operation to the executive  action  of	 the
Government  of	India  under  clause  (1)  of  Article	 77.
Similarly,  clause (2) or clause (3) of Article 166  is	 not
limited	 in  its operation to the executive  action  of	 the
Government  of	the State under clause (1) of  Article	166.
The  expression	 ""Business of the Government  of  India""  in
clause	(3) of Article 77, and the expression  ""Business  of
the  Government of the State"" in clause (3) of	Article	 166
includes all executive business.



In  all	 cases	in  which  the	President  or  the  Governor
exercises  his	functions conferred on him by or  under	 the
Constitution  with  the	 aid and advice of  his	 Council  of
Ministers  he  does  so	 by  making  rule-.  for  convenient
transaction  of the business of the Government of  India  or
the  Government of the State respectively or  by  allocation
among his Ministers of the saidbusiness, in accordance	with
Article	 77  (3)  and  166(3)  respectively.  Wherever	 the
Constitution  requires	the satisfaction of  Presidents	 the
Governor  for the exercise of any power or function  by	 the
President  or  the  Governor, as the case  may	be,  as	 for
example	 in  Articles' 123, 21-3, 311(2) proviso  (c),	317,
352(1),	 356  and  360	the  satisfaction  required  by	 the
Constitution  is  not  the  Personal  satisfaction  of	 the
President or of the Governor but is the satisfaction of	 the
President  or  of the Governor in the  Constitutional  sense
under  the  Cabinet system of Government.  The	reasons	 are
these.	It is the satisfaction of the, Council of  Ministers
on  whose  aid	and advice the	President  or  the  Governor
generally  exercises all his powers and functions.   Neither
Article 77(3) nor Article 166(3) provides for any delegation
of power.  Both Articles 77(3) and 166(3) provide

that  the  President under Article 77(3)  and  the  Governor
under	Article	 166(3)	 shall	make  rules  for  the	more
convenient  transactions of the business of  the  Government
and  the allocation of business among the ministers  of	 the
said  business.	  The rules of business and  the  allocation
among  the Ministers of the said business all indicate	that
the  decision of any Minister or officer under the rules  of
business  make under these two Articles viz., Article  77(3)
in the case of the President and Article 166(3) in the	case
of  the	 Governor  of  the State  is  the  decision  of	 the
President or the Governor respectively.



831
The Rules of Business in the Bejoy Lakshmi Cotton Mills case
(supra) indicated that the business of the Government was to
be  transacted	in  various  departments  specified  in	 the
Schedules.   Land  and	Land Revenue was  allocated  as	 the
business  of  the  Department  of  the	Minister  with	that
portfolio.    The  Minister-in-charge  had  power  to	make
standing Order regarding disposal of cases.  This Court held
that the decision of any Minister or officer under Rules  of
Business  is  a decision of the President  or  the  Governor
respectively.	The Governor means, the Governor  aided	 and
advised by the Ministers.  Neither Article 77(3) nor Article
166(3)	provides for any delegation of power.  Although	 the
executive  power  of  the State is vested  in  the  Governor
actually  it  is  carried on by	 Ministers  under  Rules  of
Business  made	under  Article 166(3).	 The  allocation  of
business of the Government is the decision, of the President
or the Governor on the aid and advice of Ministers.
This  Court in Jayantilal Amritlal Shodhan v. F. N.  Rana  &
Ors.  [1964]  5 S. C. R. 294 considered the  validity  of  a
notification issued by the President under Article 258(1) of
the   Constitution  entrusting	with  the  consent  of	 the
Government  of Bombay to the Commissioners of  Divisions  in
the State of Bombay the functions of the Central  Government
under	the  Land  Acquisition	Act  in	 relation   to	 the
acquisition of land for the purposes of the Union within the
territorial   jurisdiction   of	 the   Commissioners.	 The
notification  issued  by the President was  dated  24  July,
1959.  The Commissioner of Baroda Division, State of Gujarat
by  notification published on 1 September, 1960,  exercising
functions  under  the notification issued by  the  President
notified under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act that
certain	 land  belonging to the appellant was needed  for  a
public	 purpose.    On	 1  May,  1960	under	the   Bombay
Reorganization	Act, 1960 two States were carved out,  viz.,
Maharashtra  and Gujarat.  The appellant contended that	 the
notification  issued by the President under  Article  258(1)
was  ineffective  without the consent of the  Government  of
the, newly formed State of Gujarat.



	       *	 *		*	       *
	      The  appellant urges that the House of  People
	      having  been dissolved this clause  cannot  be
	      complied	with.  According to him	 it  follows
	      from the provisions of this Clause that it was
	      contemplated  that on the dissolution  of	 the
	      House  of	 People the Prime Minister  and	 the
	      other ministers must resign or be dismissed by
	      the President and the President must carry  on
	      the Government as best as he can with the	 aid
	      of  the  Services.  As we	 have  shown  above,
	      Article 74(1) is mandatory and, therefore, the
	      President	 cannot exercise power	without	 the
	      aid  and advice of the Council  of  Ministers.
	      We  must	then  harmonize	 the  provisions  of
	      Article 75 (3) with Article 74 (1) and Article
	      75(2). Article 75 (3) brings into  existence
	      what is usually called Responsible Government.
	      In  other words the Council of Ministers	must
	      enjoy  the confidence of the House of  People.
	      While  the House of People is-  not  dissolved
	      under  Article  82(2) (b) Article 75  (3)	 has
	      full operation.  But when it is dissolved	 the
	      Council  of Ministers cannot  naturally  enjoy
	      the confidence of the House of People.  Nobody
	      has  said that the Council of  Ministers	does
	      not  enjoy  the  confidence of  the  House  of

Though Balaji was referred to, we must point out with respect that Balaji does not support the above statement. Balaji indeed said that ""though castes in relation to Hindus may be a relevant factor to consider in determining the social backwardness of groups or classes of citizens, it cannot be made the sole or the dominant test in that behalf.""

40. Thomas marks the beginning of a new thinking on Article 16, though the seed of this thought is to be found in the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. The Kerala Government had, by amending Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules empowered the Government to exempt, by order, for a specified period, any member or members belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes and already in service, from passing the test which an employee had to pass as a precondition for promotion to next higher post. Exercising the said power, the Government of Kerala issued a notification granting ""temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified, special or departmental test) for a period of two years"". On the basis of the said exemption, a large number of employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who had been stagnating in their respective posts for want of passing the departmental tests, were promoted. They were now required to pass the tests within the period of exemption. Out of 51 vacancies which arose in the category of Upper Division Clerks in the year 1972, 34 were filled up by members of Scheduled Castes leaving only 17 for others. This was questioned by Thomas, a member belonging to non-reserved category. His grievance was: but for the said concession/exemption given to members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes he would have been promoted to one of those posts in view of his passing the relevant tests. He contended that Article 16(4) permits only reservations in favour of backward classes but not such an exemption. This argument was accepted by the Kerala High Court. It also upheld the further contention that inasmuch as more than 50% vacancies in the year had gone to the members of Scheduled Castes as a result of the said exemption, it is bed for violating the 50% rule in Balaji. The Stats of Kerala carried the matter in appeal to this Court which was allowed by a majority of 5:2. All the Seven Judges wrote separate opinions. The head-note to the decision in Supreme Court Reports succinctly sets out the principles enunciated in each of the judgments. We do not wish to burden this judgment by reproducing them here. We would rest content with delineating the broad features emerging from these opinions. Ray, CJ. held that Article 16(1), being a facet of Article 14, permits reasonable classification. Article 16(4) clarifies and explains that classification on the basis of backwardness. Classification of Scheduled Castes does not fall within the mischief of Article 16(2) since Scheduled Castes historically oppressed and backward, are not castes. The concession granted to them is permissible under and legitimate for the purposes of Article 16(1). The rule giving preference to an un-represented or under-represented backward community does not contravene Articles 14, 16(1) or 16(2). Any doubt on this score is removed by Article 16(4). He opined further that for determining whether a reservation is excessive or not one must have to look to the total number of posts in a given unit or department, as the case may be. Mathew, J. agreed that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1), that. Article 16(1) permits reasonable classification and that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2). He espoused the theory of 'proportional equality' evolved in certain American decisions. He does not refer to the decisions in Balaji or Devadasan in his opinion nor does he express any opinion the extent of permissible reservation. Beg, J. adopted a different reasoning. According to him, the rule and the orders issued thereunder was ""a kind of reservation"" falling under Article 16(4) itself. Krishna Iyer,J. was also of the opinion that Article 16(1) being a facet of Article 16 permits reasonable classification, that Article 16(4) is not an exception but an emphatic statement of what is inherent in Article 16(1) and further that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2) but a collection of castes, races and groups. Article 16(4) is one made of reconciling the claims of backward people and the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily entitled to, held the learned Judge. He approved the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. Fazal Ali, J. too adopted a similar approach. The learned Judge pointed out ""if we read Article 16(4) as an exception to Article 16(1) then the inescapable conclusion would be that Article 16(1) does not permit any classification at all because an express provision has been made for this in Clause (4). This, however, is contrary to the basic concept of equality contained in Article 14 which implicitly permits classification in any form provided certain conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, if no classification can be made under Article 16(1) except reservation contained in Clause (4) then the mandate contained in Article 335 would be defeated."" He held that the Rule and the orders impugned are referable to and sustainable under Article 16. The learned Judge went further and held that the rule of 50% evolved in Balaji is a mere rule of caution and was not meant to be exhaustive of all categories. He expressed the opinion that the extent of reservation depends upon the proportion of the backward classes to the total population and their representation in public services. He expressed a doubt as to the correctness of the majority view in Devadasan. Among the minority Khanna, J. preferred the view taken in Balaji and other cases to the effect that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). He opined that no preference can be provided in favour of backward classes outside Clause (4). A.C.Gupta, J. concurred with this view.



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.



PART - IV (QUESTIONS 3, 4 AND 5)
 
 

Question 3(a): Meaning of the expression ""Backward Class of citizens"" in Article 16(4).

60. What does the expression ""Backward Class of Citizens"" in Article 16(4) signify and how should they be identified? This has been the single most difficult question tormenting this nation. The expression is not defined in the Constitution. What does it mean then? The arguments before us mainly revolved round this question. Several shades of opinion have been presented to us ranging from one extreme to the other. Indeed, it may be difficult to set out in full the reasoning presented before us orally and in several written propositions submitted by various counsel. We can mention only the substance of and the broad features emerging from those submissions. At one end of the spectrum stands Sri N.A. Palkhiwala (supported by several other counsel) whose submissions may briefly be summarised in the following words: a secular, unified and caste-less society is a basic feature of the Constitution. Caste is a prohibited ground of distinction under the Constitution. It ought be erased altogether
 from the Indian Society. It can never be the basis for determining backward classes referred to in Article 16(4). The Report of the Mandal Commission, which is the basis of the impugned Memorandums, has treated the expression ""backward classes"" as synonymous with backward castes and has proceed to identify backward classes solely and exclusively on the basis of caste, ignoring all other considerations including poverty. It has indeed invented castes for Non-Hindus where none exists. The Report has divided the nation into two sections, backward and forward, placing 52% of the population in the former section. Acceptance of Report would spell disaster to the unity and integrity of the nation. If half of the posts are reserved for backward classes, it would seriously jeopardise the efficiency of the administration, educational system, and all other services
 resulting in backwardness of the entire nation. Merit will disappear
 by deifying backwardness. Article 16(4) is broader than Article 15(4). The expression ""backward class of citizens"" in Article 16(4) is not limited to ""socially and educationally backward classes"" in Article 15(4). The impugned Memorandums, based on the said report must necessarily fall to the ground along with the Report. In fact the main thrust of Sri Palkhiwala's argument has been against the Mandal Commission Report.



64. Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned Counsel appearing for Srinarayana Dharama Paripalana Yogam (an association of Ezhavas in Kerala) submitted that Article 16(4) and 15(4) occupy different fields and serve different purposes. Whereas Article 15(4) contemplates positive action programmes, Article 16(4) enables the State to undertake schemes of positive discrimination. For this reason, the class of intended beneficiaries under both the clauses is different. The social and educational backwardness which is the basis of identifying backwardness
 under Article 15(4) is only partly true in the case of 'backward class of citizens' in Article 16(4). The expression ""any backward class of citizens"" occurring in Article 16(4) must be understood in the light of the purpose of the said clause namely, empowerment of those groups and classes which have been kept out of the administration - classes which have suffered historic disabilities
 arising from discrimination or disadvantage or both and who must now be provided entry into the administrative apparatus. In the light of the fact that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also intended to be beneficiaries of Article 16(4) there is no reason why caste cannot be an exclusive criteria for determining beneficiaries under Article 16(4). Counsel emphasised the fact that Article 16(4) speaks of group protection and not individual protection.",
Article 4,Constitution of India,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/237570/,,,
Article 4,"The State Of Bihar vs Maharajadhiraja Sir Kameshwar Singhof ... on 27 May, 1952",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/41868/?formInput=Article%204,,"It	will be seen that the scope of article 31 (4) is  at
once  narrower	and  wider than that of	 article  31-A;	 the
former	has application only to statutes which were  pending
in the legislature at the commencement of the  Constitution,
whereas	 the  latter  is subject  to  no  such	restriction.
Again,	article	 31 (4)	 excludes attack only on the  ground
of contravention of article 31 (2), while article 3 I-A bars
objections  based  on contravention of other  provisions  of
Part  III as well, such as articles 14 and 19.	This  indeed
was the reason for the enactment of articles 31-A and  31-B,
as the words of exclusion in article 31 (4) were found inapt
to  cover objections based on contravention of	article	 14.
On  the	 other hand, the law referred to in article  31	 (4)
covers	acquisition of any kind of property,  while  article
31-A relates only to the acquisition of a particular kind of
property, viz., estates and rights therein, and what is more
important  for our present purpose, the non obstante  clause
in  article  31 (4) overrides all other	 provisions  in	 the
Constitution  including	 the List of the  Seventh  Schedule,
whereas	 a law which falls within the purview of  article  a
1-A  could  only prevail over ""the foregoing  provisions  of
this Part"". Now, the three impugned statutes fall within the
ambit  of  both article 31 (4) and articles 31-A  and  31-B.
Putting	 aside	the latter articles for the  moment,  it  is
plain  that, under article 31 (4), the three impugned  stat-
utes  are protected from attack in any court on	 the  ground
that they contravene the provisions of article 31(2).  These
provisions, so far as they are material here, are (i) that a
law with respect to acquisition of property should authorize
acquisition  only  for	a public purpose and (ii) that	such
law  should  provide for compensation, etc. Mr.	 Das,  while
admitting that




(ii) was a ""provision"" of article 31 (2), submitted that (i)
was  not.   According to him clause (2)assumed but  did	 not
""provide""  that acquisition should be authorised only for  a
public	purpose.  I cannot accept that view. In my  opinion,
the  clause seeks also to impose a limitation in  regard  to
public	purpose.   The clause was evidently worded  in	that
form  as it was copied (with minor variations) from  section
299  (2)  of the Government of India Act,  1935,  which	 was
undoubtedly designed to give effect to the recommendation of
the  Joint  Parliamentary Committee in para.  369  of  their
Report	that two conditions should be imposed on  expropria-
tion  of  private  property:  ""We think	 it  (the  provision
proposed)  should secure that legislation  expropriating  or
authorising  the  expropriation of the property	 of  private
individuals should be lawful only if confined to  expropria-
tion  for public purpose and if compensation  is  determined
either in the first instance or in appeal by some  independ-
ent  authority"". It is thus clear that section 299  (2)	 was
intended  to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject  to
which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private
property  should be lawful, and it seems reasonable to	con-
clude  that  article 31 (2) was also intended to impose	 the
same  two  conditions on legislation  expropriating  private
property.    In	 other	words, article 31 (2)must be  under-
stood as also providing that legislation authorising  expro-
priation of private property should be lawful only if it was
required  for  a public purpose and provision was  made	 for
payment of compensation.  Indeed if this were not so,  there
would be nothing in the Constitution to prevent	 acquisition
for  a non-public or private purpose and without payment  of
compensation--an  absurd result. It cannot be supposed	that
the  framers of	 the Constitution, while expressly  enacting
one of the two well-established restrictions on the exercise
of the right of eminent domain, left the other to be import-
ed  from the common law.  Article 81 (2) must therefore,  be
taken to provide for both the limitations in express  terms.
An attack on the

ground of contravention of these provisions implies that the
law in question authorises acquisition without reference  to
a public purpose and without payment of compensation.	This
was  precisely the objection raised both by Mr. Das and	 Dr.
Ambedkar  to  the constitutional validity  of  the  impugned
statutes, and such objection really amounts to calling those
laws  in  question on the ground that they  contravened	 the
provisions of article 31 (2), though learned counsel stoutly
denied	that they were relying on the provisions of  article
31(2).	 The denial, however, seems to me to be based  on  a
quibbling  distinction	without a difference  in  substance.
Their  main  attack was really grounded on  the	 absence  of
these  two  essential  prerequisites  of  valid	 legislation
authorising acquisition of private property, though Mr.	 Das
would  deduce them by implication from entry 36 of  List  II
and  entry  42	of List III, while Dr.	Ambedkar  sought  to
derive	them from the spirit of the Constitution.  But	this
is only a form of stating the objection which, in substance,
is  that  the statutes are bad because of the absence  of  a
public	purpose and the omission to provide for a just	com-
pensation.   This, in fact, was the burden of  the  argument
before us. If, then, these two grounds of attack fall within
the  purview  of article 31(4), the  words  ""notwithstanding
anything  in  this  Constitution"" are apt  to  exclude	such
grounds howsoever they are derived--whether from the entries
in the legislative Lists or from the spirit of the Constitu-
tion-for  both alike are covered by those words. Indeed,  if
the  objection based on the absence of a public purpose	 and
of a provision for just compensation were still to be  open,
clause	(4) of article 31  would be meaningless	 surplusage.
It  is	obvious that that clause was specially	designed  to
protect	 the  impugned	statutes and  other  laws  similarly
enacted	 from  attack  in a court of law  on  the  aforesaid
grounds	 and, if they were nevertheless to be considered  as
not being within the protection, it is difficult to see what
the  use of article 31 (4) would be.  Learned  counsel	were
unable to suggest any.	The fact is that article 31 (4) was

designed  to  bar the jurisdiction of  courts  to  entertain
objections to the validity of a certain class of  enactments
on  the	 two-fold ground referred to above,  and  its  whole
purpose	 would stand  defeated if the zemindars'  contention
were to prevail.



    That  the obligation to provide for compensation is	 not
included in the content of the legislative power under entry
36 in List II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List	III,
will be made further clear when we come to consider  closely
clauses (4) and (5) of article 31 and article 31-A.  Article
31(4)  protects a law of the description  mentioned  therein
against the provisions of article 31(2). It follows,  there-
fore,  that what is sought to be protected by article  31(4)
is a law for the acquisition or taking possession of proper-
ty which does not, amongst other things, provide for compen-
sation or

does  not fix the amount or specify the principles on  which
and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined
and given, for otherwise there would be no necessity for any
protection.  The question at once arises as to whether there
is  any legislative entry in List 11 under which a  law	 for
acquisition or taking possession of property without compen-
sation	can  be made by a State Legislature.   To  test	 the
validity of Mr. P.R. Das's argument and to avoid the compli-
cation	arising	 out of the residuary powers  of  Parliament
under  article 248 and entry 97 of List II I have taken	 the
case  of a law of acquisition made by the legislatures of  a
State  which  also come within article 31  (4).	  Is  there,
then,  any entry in List II under which a State	 Legislature
can  make  a  law for acquisition  without  compensation  or
public purpose ? Obviously there is none, except entry 36 in
List  II.  If that entry by itself or read with entry 42  in
List  III has any implication as suggested, namely,  that  a
law for acquisition of property-made under entry 36 in	List
II  without a provision for compensation will be beyond	 the
legislative   competency  of the  State	 Legislatures,	then
there  is no other entry under which such a law can be	made
by a State Legislature and there can, therefore, be no point
in  making  a  provision in article  81(4)  for	 protecting,
against	 article  31(2), a law which,  on  this	 hypothesis.
cannot be made at all. Article 81(4) postulates a law  which
offends against 31 (2) and so far as the State	Legislatures
are  concerned there is no entry in List II except entry  36
under  which such an offending law may be made by the  State
Legislatures.  This  circumstance  unmistakably	 establishes
that entry 36 in List II, by itself or read with-entry 42 in
List III, has not any such implication as is imputed to	 it.
Likewise  take	article 81 (5) (b) (ii) which  protects	 the
provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make for
the  promotion of public health or the prevention of  danger
to  life  or property.	The law which is thus sought  to  be
protected must also involve acquisition of property  without
any  provision for compensation, for otherwise there can  be
no occasion or necessity for

any protection against article 31 (2).	A law of this  kind,
in so far as such law provides for acquisition of  property,
must necessarily be made by a State Legislature. if at	all,
under  entry 36 in List II.  If Mr. P.R.  Das's	 contentions
were  correct,	a  law for the promotion of  health  or	 the
prevention  of	danger	to life or  property  involving	 the
acquisition  of property without a provision  for  compensa-
tion,  which is what is sought to be protected from  article
31 (2), can never be made, for the obligation to provide for
compensation  is, according to him, implicit in	 entry36  in
List  II, by itself or read with entry 42 in List  III,	 and
there  is no other entry under which a law may be made by  a
State  Legislature with respect to acquisition of  property.
It is futile to attempt to get over this anomaly by suggest-
ing  that  clauses (4) and (5) (b) (ii) of article  31	have
been inserted in the Constitution ex abundanti cautela, for,
if Mr. P.R. Das were correct in his submission, no amount of
caution was necessary for protecting a law that, ex  hypoth-
esi, cannot be made at all. Similar arguments may as well be
founded	 on article 31-A, for that article also	 protects  a
law from article 31 (2) which is in Part III of the  Consti-
tution. It is suggested that article 31-A postulates a valid
law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of	 its
legislative  powers. If a State Legislature in making a	 law
for  the acquisition of property for a public purpose  under
entry 36 in List II must provide for compensation then a law
made  conformably  with this supposed  requirement  of	that
entry  by a State Legislature will require no protection  at
all against article 31 (2), and article 31-A must be regard-
ed as meaningless and unnecessary.   Surely, that conclusion
is  manifestly	untenable.  In my opinion  clauses  (4)	 and
(5)(b) (ii) of article 31 and article 31-A clearly  negative
Mr. P.R. Das's proposition.  In my judgment, for the reasons
stated	above, the  major premise in the arguments  advanced
by  Mr.	 P.R. Das under 'the first head,  namely,  that	 the
obligation  to pay compensation is implicit in entry  36  in
Lis  II by itself or read with entry 42 in List III  is	 un-
sound.



    Assuming  that the obligation to pay compensation  which
is  expressly provided in article 31(2) is also implicit  in
entry 36 in List II by itself or read with entry 42 in	List
III, the respondents cannot. even then, be permitted to call
in  question the validity of the impugned Act on the  ground
that  it  does not provide for compensation, for  then	they
will  be  doing	 exactly what they are forbidden  to  do  by
article	 31 (4) and the newly added  articles.	Article31(4)
and the added articles debar the respondents from  question-
ing the validity of the Act on the ground, inter alia,	that
it  contravenes	 or is inconsistent with or  takes  away  or
abridges  any of the rights conferred by the  provisions  of
clause (2) of article 31.  The emphasis in those articles is
rather on the ""provisions"" than on the number of the article
or the Part of the Constitution. It is obvious that the real
substance  of  the matter is that articles 31(4),  31-A	 and
31-B  expressly seek to prevent a challenge to the  validity
of the Act based on the ground, inter alia, that it does not
provide	 for  compensation. This obligation to	provide	 for
compensation is no doubt one of the provisions of article 31
(2)  but  if  as contended by Mr. P.R. Das,  the  self	same
provision be found elsewhere in the same Constitution, e.g.,
entry  36  in  List II or entry 42 in List  III,  then	that
""provision"" must also be regarded as having been covered  by
article	 31(4)	and the two added  articles,  for  otherwise
those articles will be rendered nugatory.  In my opinion, if
two constructions are possible, the Court should adopt	that
which

will  implement	 and discard that which	 will  stultify	 the
apparent  intention  of	 the  makers  of  the  Constitution.
Further, it must be borne in mind that article 31 (4)  which
applies	 ""notwithstanding  anything in	this  Constitution"",
will,  by force of the very words, protect the	Act  against
even  legislative incompetency, if any, arising out  of	 the
alleged noncompliance with the suggested implied provisions,
if any, of entry 36 in List II and entry 42 in List III.  In
my  judgment the respondents are not, by reason of  articles
31(4),	31-A and 31-B, entitled to call the Act in  question
on  the	 ground that it does not provide  for  compensation,
whether	 the ground is formulated as a breach of article  31
(2) or of the implied provision, if any, of the	 legislative
heads mentioned above.",

equality in the Constitution conceives the individual right 
to be treated fairly without discrimination in the matter 
of equality of opportunity.  It also conceives of affirmative 
action in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4). It enables 
classification as a basis for enabling preferences and 
benefits for specific beneficiary groups and that neither 
classification nor affirmative action can obliterate the 
individual right to equal opportunity.  Therefore, a 
balance has to be evolved to promote equal opportunities 
while protecting individual rights.  It is urged that as an 
individual right in Article 16(1), enforceability is provided 
for whereas ""group expectation"" in Article 16(4) is not a 
fundamental right but it is an enabling power which is 
not coupled with duty.  It is submitted that if the 
structural balance of equality in the light of the efficiency 
is disturbed and if the individual right is encroached 
upon by excessive support for group expectations, it 
would amount to reverse discrimination.



	At the outset, this Court stated that it was not 
concerned with the validity of constitutional amendments 
and, therefore, it proceeded on the assumption that 
Article 16(4A) is valid and is not unconstitutional.  
Basically, the question decided was whether the 'catch-
up' principle was tenable in the context of Article 16(4).  
It was held that the primary purpose of Article 16(4) and 
Article 16(4A) is to give due representation to certain 
classes in certain posts keeping in mind Articles 14, 16(1) 
and 335; that, Articles 14 and 16(1) have prescribed 
permissive limits to affirmative action by way of 
reservation under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the 
Constitution; that, Article 335 is incorporated so that 
efficiency of administration is not jeopardized and that 
Articles 14 and 16(1) are closely connected as they deal 
with individual rights of the persons.  They give a positive 
command to the State that there shall be equality of 
opportunity of all citizens in public employment.  It was 
further held that Article 16(1) flows from Article 14. It 
was held that the word 'employment' in Article 16(1) is 
wide enough to include promotions to posts at the stage 
of initial level of recruitment.  It was observed that Article 
16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for 
promotion fundamental right to be considered for 
promotion.  It was held that equal opportunity means the 
right to be considered for promotion.  The right to be 
considered for promotion was not a statutory right.  It 
was held that Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) did not confer any 
fundamental right to reservation.  That they are only 
enabling provisions.  Accordingly, in Ajit Singh (II)3, the 
judgment of this Court in Jagdish Lal20 case was 
overruled.  However, in the context of balancing of 
fundamental rights under Article 16(1) and the rights of 
reserved candidate under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A), this 
Court opined that Article 16(1) deals with a fundamental 
right whereas Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) are only enabling 
provisions and, therefore, the interests of the reserved 
classes must be balanced against the interests of other 
segments of society.  As a remedial measure, the Court 
held that in matters relating to affirmative action by the 
State, the rights under Articles 14 and 16 are required to 
be protected and a reasonable balance should be struck 
so that the affirmative action by the State does not lead 
to reverse discrimination.



Clauses (1) and (4) of Article 16 are restatements of the 
principle of equality under Article 14.  Clause (4) of 
Article 16 refers to affirmative action by way of 
reservation.  Clause (4) of Article 16, however, states that 
the appropriate Government is free to provide for 
reservation in cases where it is satisfied on the basis of 
quantifiable data that backward class is inadequately 
represented in the services.  Therefore, in every case 
where the State decides to provide for reservation there 
must exist two circumstances, namely, 'backwardness' 
and 'inadequacy of representation'.  As stated above  
equity, justice and efficiency are variable factors.  These 
factors are context-specific.  There is no fixed yardstick to 
identify and measure these three factors, it will depend 
on the facts and circumstances of each case.  These are 
the limitations on the mode of the exercise of power by 
the State.  None of these limitations have been removed 
by the impugned amendments. If the concerned State 
fails to identify and measure backwardness, inadequacy 
and overall administrative efficiency then in that event 
the provision for reservation would be invalid. These 
amendments do not alter the structure of Articles 14, 15 
and 16 (equity code).  The parameters mentioned in 
Article 16(4) are retained.  Clause (4A) is derived from 
clause (4) of Article 16.  Clause (4A) is confined to SCs 
and STs alone.  Therefore, the present case does not 
change the identity of the Constitution.  The word 
""amendment"" connotes change.  The question is  
whether the impugned amendments discard the original 
constitution.   It was vehemently urged on behalf of the 
petitioners that the Statement of Objects and Reasons 
indicate that the impugned amendments have been 
promulgated by the Parliament to overrule the decision of 
this court.  We do not find any merit in this argument.  
Under Article 141 of the Constitution the pronouncement 
of this court is the law of the land.  The judgments of this 
court in Virpal Singh1, Ajit Singh (I)2 , Ajit Singh (II)3 
and Indra Sawhney5, were judgments delivered by this 
court which enunciated the law of the land.  It is that law 
which is sought to be changed by the impugned 
constitutional amendments.  The impugned 
constitutional amendments are enabling in nature.  They 
leave it to the States to provide for reservation.  It is well-
settled that the Parliament while enacting a law does not 
provide content to the ""right"".  The content is provided by 
the judgments of the Supreme Court.  If the appropriate 
Government enacts a law providing for reservation 
without keeping in mind the parameters in Article 16(4) 
and Article 335 then this court will certainly set aside 
and strike down such legislation.  Applying the ""width 
test"", we do not find obliteration of any of the 
constitutional limitations.  Applying the test of ""identity"", 
we do not find any alteration in the existing structure of 
the equality code.  As stated above, none of the axioms 
like secularism, federalism etc. which are overarching 
principles have been violated by the impugned 
constitutional amendments.  Equality has two facets  
""formal equality"" and ""proportional equality"".  
Proportional equality is equality ""in fact"" whereas formal 
equality is equality ""in law"".  Formal equality exists in the 
Rule of Law.  In the case of proportional equality the 
State is expected to take affirmative steps in favour of 
disadvantaged sections of the society within the 
framework of liberal democracy.  Egalitarian equality is 
proportional equality.   



It is important to bear in mind the nature of 
constitutional amendments.  They are curative by nature.  
Article 16(4) provides for reservation for backward classes 
in cases of inadequate representation in public 
employment.  Article 16(4) is enacted as a remedy for the 
past historical discriminations against a social class.  
The object in enacting the enabling provisions like 
Articles 16(4), 16(4A) and 16(4B) is that the State is 
empowered to identify and recognize the compelling 
interests.  If the State has quantifiable data to show 
backwardness and inadequacy then the State can make 
reservations in promotions keeping in mind maintenance 
of efficiency which is held to be a constitutional limitation 
on the discretion of the State in making reservation as 
indicated by Article 335.  As stated above, the concepts of 
efficiency, backwardness, inadequacy of representation 
are required to be identified and measured.  That exercise 
depends on availability of data.  That exercise depends on 
numerous factors.  It is for this reason that enabling 
provisions are required to be made because each 
competing claim seeks to achieve certain goals.  How best 
one should optimize these conflicting claims can only be 
done by the administration in the context of local 
prevailing conditions in public employment.  This is 
amply demonstrated by the various decisions of this 
Court discussed hereinabove.  Therefore, there is a basic 
difference between 'equality in law' and 'equality in fact' 
(See:  'Affirmative Action' by William Darity).  If Articles 
16(4A) and 16(4B) flow from Article 16(4) and if Article 
16(4) is an enabling provision then Articles 16(4A) and 
16(4B) are also enabling provisions.  As long as the 
boundaries mentioned in Article 16(4), namely, 
backwardness, inadequacy and efficiency of 
administration are retained in Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B) 
as controlling factors, we cannot attribute constitutional 
invalidity to these enabling provisions.  However, when 
the State fails to identify and implement the controlling 
factors then excessiveness comes in, which is to be 
decided on the facts of each case.  In a given case, where 
excessiveness results in reverse discrimination, this 
Court has to examine individual cases and decide the 
matter in accordance with law.  This is the theory of 
'guided power'.  We may once again repeat that equality 
is not violated by mere conferment of power but it is 
breached by arbitrary exercise of the power conferred.",

	  Constitution	is  not	 static:  We  shall  at	 the
	  outset  deal	with  the contention raised  by	 Sri
	  D.D.Thakur,  learned senior counsel appearing	 for
	  the reserved candidates that Article 16(4) must be
	  interpreted	keeping	 in   mind  the	  conditions
	  prevailing  fifty years ago when the	Constitution
	  was	drafted	  and  when    Article	 16(4)	 was
	  incorporated in the Constitution.  Learned counsel
	  submitted that the founding fathers were conscious
	  that	a  special  provision  for  reservation	 was
	  necessary  to	 see  that the backward	 classes  of
	  citizens   were  adequately	represented  in	 the
	  services.   Hence  an interpretation	which  would
	  advance  the	said  objective	  must	be  applied.
	  Reliance  was	 also  placed on  the  Statement  of
	  Objects  and	Reasons	 in   connection  with	 the
	  incorporation of Article 16(4A).  In fact, all the
	  learned   counsel  appearing	 for  the   reserved
	  candidates  contended that the said officers could
	  not be treated as equals to the general candidates
	  and  that  their  backwardness   and	past  social
	  oppression must be borne in mind.  Nobody can deny
	  that	the  above approach is the proper one  while
	  dealing  with	 the reserved classes.	The  primary
	  purpose of Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A) is due
	  representation  of  certain	classes	 in  certain
	  posts.   However,  we	 must bear in mind  and	 not
	  ignore  that	there are other provisions,  namely,
	  Articles   14,  16(1)	 and   Article	335  of	 the
	  Constitution	which are also very important.	 The
	  Constitution	has  laid  down in Articles  14	 and
	  16(1) the permissible limits of affirmative action
	  by  way  of reservation under Articles  16(4)	 and
	  16(4A).  While permitting reservations at the same
	  time,	 it  has also placed certain limitations  by
	  way  of Articles 14 and 16(1) so that there is  no
	  reverse  discrimination.  It has also incorporated
	  Article   335	  so   that    the   efficiency	  of
	  administration   is	not    jeopardized.    While
	  interpreting provisions of the Constitution and in
	  particular  fundamental rights of citizens, it  is
	  well to bear in mind certain fundamental concepts.
	  In  McCulloch	 Vs.  Maryland ( 1819) 4  Wheel	 (17
	  U.S.316), Chief Justice Marshall cautioned that we
	  must keep in mind that it is the Constitution that
	  we  are expounding.  He said that the Constitution
	  was  intended	 to endure for ages to come and	 had
	  consequently	to be adapted to the various  crises
	  of  human  affairs from time to time.	 Brandeis  J
	  wrote	 :   ""Our  Constitution is  not	 a  straight
	  jacket.   It is a living organism.  As such it  is
	  capable  of growth, of expansion and of adaptation
	  to   new  conditions.	   Growth  implies  changes,
	  political,  economic and social.  Growth which  is
	  significant	 manifests    itself	rather	  in
	  intellectual	and  moral conceptions	of  material
	  things""  (Brandeis  Papers, Harvard  Law  School).
	  Similarly, in a beautiful metaphor Mr.  J.M.	Beck
	  said as follows:



while  the  rights covered by Articles 16(4) and 16(4A)	 are
""fundamental  rights"".	Such a view has also been  expressed
in Jagdish Lal and some other latter cases where these cases
have been followed.  Counsel submitted that this was not the
correct	 constitutional	 position.  In this  connection	 our
attention  has been invited to para 43 of Ashok Kumar Gupta.
It reads as follows:-

	  ""It would thus be clear that right to promotion is
a  statutory  right.   It is not a fundamental	right.	 The
right  to promotion to a post or class of posts depends upon
the  operation of the conditions of service.  Article  16(4)
read  with  Articles  16(1)  and 14 guarantees	a  right  to
promotion  to Dalits and Tribes as a fundamental right where
they  do not have adequate representation consistently	with
the  efficiency of administration...  before expiry  thereof
(i.e.  5 years rule), Article 16(4) has come into force from
17.6.1995.  Therefore, the right to promotion continues as a
constitutionally  guaranteed  fundamental right."" A  similar
view was expressed in Jagdishlal and followed in some latter
cases.	 In  the  above	 passage,  it  was  laid  down	that
promotion  was a statutory right and that Articles 16(4) and
16(4A)	conferred  fundamental rights.	In our opinion,	 the
above  view expressed in Ashok Kumar Gupta, and followed  in
Jagdish	 Lal and other cases, if it is intended to lay	down
that   the   right  guaranteed	to   employees	 for   being
""considered""  for  promotion according to relevant rules  of
recruitment by promotion(i.e.  whether on basis of seniority
or  merit)  is only a statutory right and not a	 fundamental
right,	we  cannot accept the proposition.  We have  already
stated	earlier	 that the right to equal opportunity in	 the
matter	of  promotion  in  the	sense	of  a  right  to  be
""considered""  for  promotion is indeed a  fundamental  right
guaranteed  under  Article  16(1) and this  has	 never	been
doubted	 in  any other case before Ashok Kumar Gupta,  right
from  1950.   Articles	16(4) and 16(4A) do not	 confer	 any
fundamental  right  to	reservation:  We next  come  to	 the
question whether Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A) guaranteed
any  fundamental  right to reservation.	 It should be  noted
that  both these Articles open with a non-obstante clause  -
""Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from making
any  provision	for  reservation....."".	 There is  a  marked
difference  in the language employed in Article 16(1) on the
one  hand and Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A).	 There is no
directive  or command in Article 16(4) or Article 16(4A)  as
in  Article 16(1).  On the face of it, the above language in
each  of  Articles 16(4) and 16(4A), is in the nature of  an
enabling  provision  and  it has been so held  in  judgments
rendered  by  Constitution Benches and in other cases  right
from  1963.   We may in this connection point out  that	 the
attention  of  the  learned Judges who decided	Ashok  Kumar
Gupta  and  Jagdish Lal was not obviously drawn to a  direct
case  decided  by a Constitution Bench in C.A.Rajendran	 vs.
Union  of  India 1968 (1) SCC 721 which arose under  Article
16(4).	 It  was clearly laid down by the five	Judge  Bench
that  Article  16(4)  was only an enabling  provision,	that
Article	 16(4)	was not a fundamental right and that it	 did
not  impose  any constitutional duty.  It only	conferred  a
discretion  on	the  State.  The passage in the	 above	case
reads as follows:



	  ""In  this connection, it is necessary to emphasise
that  Article  15(4)  like  Article  16(4)  is	an  enabling
provision,  it	does  not impose an obligation,	 but  merely
leaves it to the discretion of the appropriate government to
take suitable action, if necessary.""

 Unfortunately, all these rulings of larger Benches
were  not  brought to the notice of the Bench which  decided
Ashok  Kumar Gupta and Jagdish Lal and to the Benches  which
followed  these	 two  cases.  In view  of  the	overwhelming
authority  right from 1963, we hold that both Articles 16(4)
and  16(4A) do not confer any fundamental rights nor do they
impose	any constitutional duties but are only in the nature
of  enabling provision vesting a discretion in the State  to
consider   providing   reservation  if	 the   circumstances
mentioned  in  those Articles so warranted.  We	 accordingly
hold  that on this aspect Ashok Kumar Gupta, Jagdishlal	 and
the cases which followed these cases do not lay down the law
correctly.   Power  is	coupled with duty:   Learned  senior
counsel for the reserved candidates, Sri K.Parasaran however
contended  that	 Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A)  confer  a
power  coupled with a duty and that it would be	 permissible
to  enforce  such  a  duty by issuing a	 writ  of  mandamus.
Reliance  for  that purpose was placed upon Comptroller	 and
Auditor	 General of India, Gian Prakash vs.  K.S.Jagannathan
[1986  (2)  SCC	 679] and also on Julius  vs.	Lord  Bishop
(1880)	5  AC 214 which case was followed by this  Court  in
Commissioner  of  Police  vs.  Gordhandas Bhanji  [1952	 SCR
135].  We are unable to agree with the above contention. As
pointed out earlier, the Constitution Bench of this Court in
C.A.   Rajendran Vs.  Union of India (1968(1) SCR 721)	held
that Article 16(4) conferred a discretion and did not create
any  constitutional  duty or obligation.  In fact,  in	that
case,  a  mandamus  was sought to direct the  Government  of
India  to  provide  for reservation under Article  16(4)  in
certain	 Class	I  and Class II	 services.   The  Government
stated	that  in  the  context of Article  335	and  in	 the
interests  of efficiency of administration at those  levels,
it was of the view that there should be no reservation.	 The
said opinion of the Government was accepted by this Court as
reasonable and mandamus was refused.  Even in M.R.  Balaji's
case,  the  Constitution Bench declared that  Article  16(4)
conferred   only  a  discretion. It	is  true   that	  in
Jagannathan's case, the three Judge Bench issued a mandamus,
after referring to Article 142, that the Government must add
25  marks  to  SC/ST  candidates who had  taken	 the  S.A.S.
Examination  for  promotion  as Sections Officers  and	also
that,  in  future, a reduced minimum marks must be  provided
and  announced	before	the  examination.   The	 Court	also
observed  that the Department had not passed orders as per a
general	 O.M.	of the Government dated 21.9.1977. But	 the
attention  of the Court was not drawn to the judgment of the
Constitution Bench in C.A.  Rajendran's case and other cases
to which we have referred earlier.  Further, if the State is
of  the	 opinion  that	in the interests  of  efficiency  of
administration,	 reservation  or relaxation in marks is	 not
appropriate,  then it will not be permissible for the  Court
to   issue  a  mandamus	 to   provide  for  reservation	  or
relaxation. We also note that in Superintending  Engineer,
Public	Health	Vs.   Kuldeep  Singh  (	 1997(9)  SCC  199),
Jagannathan's  case  was followed and reference was made  to
Article	 16(4) and Article 16(4A) and to the principle	that
where  a power is coupled with a duty as in Julius Vs.	Lord
Bishop	and  Commissioner of Police Vs.	 Gordhandas  Bhanji,
the  same could be enforced by the Court. But we may  point
out that even in Kuldeep Singh's case, no reference was made
to  C.A.  Rajendran and other cases.  We, accordingly,	hold
that  the view in Jagannathan and Kuldeep Singh's cases that
a  mandamus can be issued either to provide for	 reservation
or  for	 relaxation  is	 not correct  and  runs	 counter  to
judgments  of  earlier Constitution Benches and,  therefore,
these  two  judgments cannot be said to be laying  down	 the
correct law.



	  Balancing  of	 fundamental  rights  under  Article
16(1)  and the rights of reserved candidates under  Articles
16(4) and 16(4A):

 Having  noticed  that Article 16(1) deals  with  a
fundamental  right and Article 16(4) and Article 16(4A)	 are
enabling  provisions, we next come to the need for balancing
Article	 16(1)	and  Articles  16(4)  and  16(4A).   Such  a
balancing principle was enunciated by the Constitution Bench
in  1963 in M.R.  Balaji Vs.  State of Mysore :	 1963 Suppl.
(1)  SCR 439 wherein it was stated that the interests of the
reserved  classes must be balanced against the interests  of
other segments of society.  In Indira Sawhney's case, Jeevan
Reddy,	J.   explained	how  the fundamental  right  of	 the
citizens  as  declared in Article 16(1) has to	be  balanced
against	 the  claims of the reserved candidates	 in  Article
16(4).	The learned Judge stated:  (See page 734 para 808):",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles  15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article   15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article   15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article   15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article   15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



60. Shri  G.E.   Vahanvati,   learned  Solicitor  General of   India  appearing  



on behalf of the Union of India, submitted that the argument of Shri 


Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel that the American doctrine of 


""strict scrutiny"" should be applied to the affirmative action envisaged 


under Article 15(5) is not correct.   It was  argued that the impugned 


legislation is not  ex facie  discriminatory and, therefore, it cannot be 


classified as a ""suspect legislation"". It was argued that right that from  


the case of                     T
                                he General Manager    S

Subba Rao. J. (as he then was) said that ""the expression `nothing in  


this article'   is a legislative device to express its intention in a most  


emphatic way that the power conferred there under is not limited in  


any way by the main provision but falls outside it"" . The view that 


Articles   15(4)   and   16(4)   are   exceptions   to   Article   15(1)   and   16(1)  


respectively   was   again   reiterated   in  Triloki   Nath  Vs.    State   of

General further pointed out that in  State of Kerala & Anr.  Vs   N.M. 


Thomas & Ors.24   the majority opinion held that Articles 14, 15 and  


16   are   parts   of   the   scheme   of   equality   and   that   Articles   15(4)   and  


16(4) are not exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively. The  


said change in  N.M. Thomas's case  (supra) was noticed by Justice 


Chinnappa   Reddy   in  K.C.   Vasanth   Kumar   &   Anr.      Vs.    State   of 


Karnataka25    and   the   same   view   was   upheld   in  Indra   Sawhney's 


case   (supra).     The   learned   Solicitor   General   further   contended   that 


once it is accepted that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are not exceptions to  


Articles   15(1)   and   16(1)   respectively,   then   there   is   no   question   of

treating the social welfare measure as being `facially discriminatory'  


or  ""ex facie""  violative of the rule of equality.  It was argued that it is  


not simply a matter of legal equality.  De jure equality must ultimately 


find its  raison d'etre  in  de facto  equality.   The State must, therefore, 


resort   to   compensatory   State   action   for   the   purpose   of   uplifting 


people who are factually unequal in their wealth, education or social  


environment. Relying on the observations of Subba Rao, J. in        T. 


Devadasan's case (supra), it was argued that centuries of calculated 


oppression   and   habitual   submission   has   reduced   a   considerable 


section of our community to a life of serfdom and it would be well nigh 


impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of equal opportunity 


was   strictly   enforced   in   their   case   and   they   would   not   have   any 


change   if   they   were   made   to   enter   the   open   field   of   competition 


without adventitious aids till such time when they could stand on their  


own   legs. Laying   reliance   on   the   observations   made   in  N.M. 


Thomas's case (supra) and also in  Indra Sawhney's case (supra), 


the   learned   Solicitor   General   argued   that   under   Articles   15(4)   and 


16(4) the State is obliged to remove inequalities and backwardness 


from society. It was further submitted that the American doctrine of  


""strict scrutiny"" had been expressly rejected by this Court in Saurabh 


Chaudri   &   Ors.    Vs.      Union   of   India   &   Ors.26      As   regards 


identification   of   backward   classes,   the   learned   Solicitor   General  


contended   that   while   dealing   with   the   aspect   of   identification   of 


backwardness   for   socially   and   educationally   backward   classes,   it 


cannot   be   denied   that   there   is   backwardness   in   this   country;   that 


large sections of the country are socially and educationally backward;

                                               ltra vires ?

98. The   next   contention   raised   by   the   petitioner's   Counsel   is   that 



Article 15(4) and 15(5) are mutually exclusive and contradictory.  The 


Counsel   for   the   petitioner,   particularly   the   petitioner   in   Writ   Petition  


(C) No. 598 of 2006, submitted that Article 15(4) was a provision and  


a source  of  legislative  power  for the purpose of making reservation  


for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) as well as 


for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) of citizens 


in   aided   minority   educational   institutions.     And   Article   15(4)   was 


inserted after the decision of this Court in  Champakam Dorairajan 


(supra)   and   Article   15(5)   provides   for   reservation   of   seats   for   SCs,  


STs   and   SEBCs   in   aided   or   unaided   educational   institutions   but 


expressly   excludes   all   such   reservation   being   made   in   minority 


educational   institutions   covered   by   Article   30(1)   of   the   Constitution.



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article   15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article   15(5)   would   include   Article   15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.",
Article 4,"Union Of India And Anr vs Azadi Bachao Andolan And Anr on 7 October, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1960330/?formInput=Article%204,,"Some of the salient provisions of the Agreement need to be 
noticed at this juncture. The  Agreement defines a number of terms 
used therein and also contains a residuary clause.  In the 
application of the provisions of the Agreement by the contracting 
States any term not defined therein shall, unless the context 
otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has  under the laws 
in force in that contracting State, relating to the words which are 
the subject of the convention.  Article 1(e) defines 'person' so as to 
include an individual, a company and any other entity, corporate or 
non-corporate ""which is treated as a  taxable unit under the 
taxation laws in force in the respective contracting States"". The 
Central Government in the Ministry of Finance (Department of 
Revenue), in the case of India, and the Commissioner of Income 
Tax in the case of Mauritius, are defined as the ""competent 
authority"".  Article 4 provides the scope of  application of the 
Agreement.  The applicability of the Agreement is determined by 
Article 4 which reads as under;



	In our view,   this thinking of the High Court is erroneous. 
The only restriction on the power of the CBDT is to prevent it 
from interfering  with the course of assessment of any particular 
assessee or the discretion of the Commissioner of Income-Tax 
(Appeals). It would be useful to recall the background against 
which this circular was issued. 

The Income-tax authorities were seeking to examine  as to 
whether the assessees were actually residents of a third country on 
the basis of alleged control of management therefrom.  
We have already extracted the relevant provisions of Article
4 which provide that, for the purposes of the agreement, the term 
'resident of a contracting State' means any person who under the 
laws of that State is liable to taxation therein by reason of his 
domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of 
similar nature.  The term 'resident of India' and 'the resident of 
Mauritius' are to be construed accordingly.  Article 13 of the 
DTAC lays down detailed rules with regard to taxation of capital 
gains. As far as capital gains resulting from alienation of shares are 
concerned, Article 13(4) provides  that the gains derived by a 
'resident' of a contracting State  shall be taxable only in that State. 
In the instant case, such capital gains derived by a resident of 
Mauritius shall be taxable only in Mauritius.  Article 4, which we 
have already referred to, declares that the term resident of 
Mauritius' means any person who under the laws of Mauritius is 
'liable to taxation' therein by reason, inter alia, of his residence. 
Clause (2) of Article 4 enumerates detailed rules as to how the 
residential status of an individual resident in both contracting 
States has to be determined for the purposes of DTAC.  Clause(3) 
of Article 4 provides that if, after application of the detailed rules 
provided in Article 4, it is found that a person other than an 
individual is a resident of both the contracting States, then it shall 
be deemed to be a resident of the contracting State  in which its 
place of effective management is situated.  The DTAC requires the 
test of 'place of effective management' to be applied only for the 
purposes of the tie-breaker  clause in Article 4(3) which could be 
applied only when it is found that a person other than an individual 
is a resident both of  India  and Mauritius.  We see no purpose or 
justification in the DTAC for application of this test in any other 
situation.  



	Some of the assumptions underlying this contention, which 
prevailed with the High Court, need greater critical appraisal.
	Article 13(4) of the DTAC  provides that gains derived by a 
resident of a Contracting State from alienation of any property, 
other than those specified in the paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the 
Article, shall be taxable only in that State. Since most of the 
arguments centred around capital gains made on transactions in 
shares on the stock exchange in India, we may leave out of 
consideration capital gains on the type of properties contemplated 
in paras 1, 2 and 3 of Article 13 of the DTAC. The residuary clause 
in para 4 of Article 13 is relevant.  It provides that capital gains 
made on sale of shares shall be taxable only in the State of which 
the person is a 'resident' taking us back to the meaning of the term 
'resident' of a contracting State.  According to Article 4, this 
expression means any person who under the laws of that State is 
""liable to taxation"" therein by reason of his domicile, residence, 
place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.  
The terms 'resident of India' and 'resident of Mauritius' are 
required to be construed accordingly.  This takes us to the test to 
determine when a company is 'liable to taxation' in Mauritius. 



	There is a further reason in support of our view. The 
expression 'liable to taxation' has been adopted from the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
Council (OECD) Model Convention 1977.  The OECD 
commentary on article 4, defining 'resident', says: ""Conventions 
for the avoidance of double taxation do not normally concern 
themselves with the domestic laws of the Contracting States laying 
down the conditions under which a person is to be treated fiscally 
as ""resident"" and, consequently, is fully liable to tax in that State"". 
The expression used is 'liable to tax therein', by reasons of various 
factors.  This definition has been carried over even in Article 4 
dealing with 'resident' in the OECD Model Convention 1992.",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles  15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article   15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article   15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article   15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article   15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



45.    As   regards   exemption   of   minority   educational   institutions   in 


Article 15(5), it was contended that this was done to conform with the  


Constitutional   mandate   of   additional   protection   for   minorities   under 


Article 30.   It was argued that Article 15(5) does not override Article  


15(4).     They   have   to   be   read   together   as   supplementary   to   each 


other   and   Article   15(5)   being   an   additional   provision,   there   is   no  


conflict between Article 15(4) and Article 15(5). Article 15(4), 15(5), 


29(2),   30(1),   and   30(2)   all   together   constitute   a   Code   in   relation   to 


admission to educational institutions.  They have to be harmoniously  


construed in the light of the Preamble and Part IV of the Constitution. 



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article   15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article   15(5)   would   include   Article   15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.  



Article   15(5)   also   to   be   taken  as   an   enabling   provision   to   carry  out  


certain constitutional mandate and thus it is constitutionally valid and 


the contentions raised on these grounds are rejected.

3.     Whether exclusion of minority educational institutions from 


Article 15(5) is violative of Article 14 of Constitution?

101. Another contention raised by the petitioner's Counsel is that the 


exclusion of minority institutions under Article 15(5) itself is violative  


of Article 14 of the Constitution.  It was contended that the exclusion 


by itself is not severable from the rest of the provision.  This plea also  


is   not   tenable   because   the   minority   institutions   have   been   given   a  


separate   treatment   in   view   of   Article   30   of   Constitution.     Such  


classification has been held to be in accordance with the provisions 


of the Constitution.  The exemption of minority educational institutions  


has been allowed to conform Article 15(5) with the mandate of Article 


30 of the Constitution.  Moreover, both Article 15(4) and Article 15(5) 


are operative and the plea of non-severability is not applicable.",
Article 5,"K.M. Abdulla Kunhi And B.L. Abdul Khader vs Union Of India And Ors., State Of ... on 23 January, 1991",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1355334/?formInput=Article%205,,"There are two constitutional safeguards, namely, clause
(4) of Article 22, and clause (5) of Article 22.  the former
requires  that	if a detenu is liable to be detained  for  a
longer period than three months, his case shall be  referred
to   the  Advisory  Board  which  must	report	before	 the
expiration of the said period of three months that there  is
in  its	 opinion sufficient cause for such  detention.	 The
function  of  the Board is purely advisory  and	 its  report
will enable the Government to detain the person beyond three
months	provided  the detention is valid on its	 merits	 and
does not otherwise offend the Constitution.   Clause (5)  of
Article	 22  provides that when any person  is	detained  in
pursuance  of  an order made under any	law  providing	 for
preventive  detention the authority making the order  shall,
as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on
which  the  order  has been made and shall  afford  him	 the
earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.



						     110
 Section 10 prescribes the maximum period for which	 any
person	may be detained.  Section 11 provides power  to	 the
State  Government  or the Central Government to	 revoke	 the
detention  order  without  prejudice to	 the  provisions  of
Section 21 of the General Clauses Act. This revocation shall
not bar the making of another detention order under  section
3 against the same person.
     It	 is  now  beyond the pale of  controversy  that	 the
constitutional right to make representation under clause  (5)
of  Article  22	 by  necessary	implication  guarantees	 the
constitutional	 right to a proper  consideration   of	 the
representation.	 Secondly, the obligation of the  Government
to   afford   to   the	detenu	an   opportunity   to	make
representation	and  to	 consider  such	 representation	 is
distinct from the Government's obligation to refer the	case
of  detenu  along with the representation  to  the  Advisory
Board to enable it to form its opinion and send a report  to
the  Government.   It is implicit in clauses (4) and (5)  of
Article 22 that the Government while discharging its duty to
consider the representation, cannot depend upon the views of
the  Board  on such representation.  It has to consider	 the
representation	on its own without being influenced  by	 any
such view of the Board.	 The obligation of the Government to
consider the representation is different from the obligation
of  the Board to consider the representation at the time  of
hearing	 the  references.   The	 Government  considers	 the
representation to ascertain essentially whether the order is
in  conformity with the power under the law.  The Board,  on
the other hand, considers the representation and the case of
the  detenu to examine whether there is sufficient case	 for
detention.  The consideration by the Board is an  additional
safeguard  and	not a substitute for consideration  of	the
representation	by  the Government.  The right to  have	 the
representation considered by the Government, is, safeguarded
by  cl.	 (5)  of Article 22 and it  is	independent  of	 the
consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by
the  Advisory  Board  under cl. (4) of	Art.  22  read	with
section	 8(c)  of the Act. (See: Sk. Abdul Karim &  Ors.  v.
State  of  West	 Bengal,  [1969] 1  SCC	 433;  Pankaj  Kumar
Chakrabarty  &	Ors. v. State of west Bengal, [1970]  1	 SCR

of West Bengal and Ors.,[1975] 1 SCR 778.



     The  representation  relates  to  the  liberty  of	 the
individual, the highly cherished right enshrined in  Article
21 of our Constitution.
					     111
Clause (5) of Article 22 therefore, casts a legal obligation
on the Government to consider the representation as early as
possible.  it  is a constitutional  mandate  commanding	 the
concerned   authority  to  whom	 the  detenu   submits	 his
representation to consider the representation and dispose of
the  same as expeditiously as possible.	 The words ""as	soon
as may be"" occuring in clause (5) of Article 22 reflects the
concern	 of the Framers that the representation	  should  be
expeditiously  considered  and disposed of with a  sense  of
urgency	 without an avoidable delay.  However, there can  be
no  hard  and fast rule in this regard it depends  upon	 the
facts  and circumstances of each case.	There is  no  period
prescribed  either  under  the	Constitution  or  under	 the
concerned  detention  law, within which	 the  representation
should	be  dealt with.	 The requirement  however,  is	that
there should not be supine indifference slackness or callous
attitude in considering the representation.  Any unexplained
delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of
the  constitutional  imperative	 and  it  would	 render	 the
continued  detention  impermissible and illegal.   This	 has
been  emphasised and re-emphasised by a series of  decisions
of  the	 Court.	 (See: Jayanarayan Sukul v.  State  of	West
bengal,	 {1970]	 1 SCC 219; Frances Coralie Mullin  v.	W.C.
Kambra	and  Ors., [1980] 2 SCC 275; Rama Dhondu  Borade  v.
V.K.  Saraf, Commissioner of Police and Ors., [1989]  3	 SCC
173 and Aslam Ahmed Zahire Ahmed Shaik v. Union of India and
ors., [1989] 3 SCC 277.



     It is necessary to mention that with regard to  liberty
of  citizen  the  Court	 stands guard  over  the  facts	 and
requirement  of	 law,  but  Court  cannot  draw	 presumption
against any authority without material.	 It may be borne  in
mind  that the confirmation of detention does  not  preclude
the  Government	 from revoking the order of  detention	upon
considering  the  representation.  Secondly,  there  may  be
cases	where	the   Government   has	 to   consider	 the
representation only after confirmation of detention.  Clause
(5) of Article 22 suggests that the representation could  be
received even after confirmation of the order

of  detention.	 The words 'shall afford  him  the  earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the order'  in
clause (5) of Article 22 suggest that the obligation of	 the
Government is to offer the detenu an opportunity of making a
representation	against	 the order, before it  is  confirmed
according to the procedure laid down under Section 8 of	 the
Act.  But if the detenu does not exercise his right to	make
representation	at  that  stage,  but  presents	 it  to	 the
government  after the Government has confirmed the order  of
detention,  the	 Government  still  has	 to  consider	such
representation	and release the detenu if the  detention  is
not  within  the  power conferred under	 the  statute.	 The
confirmation  ofthe order of detention is not conclusive  as
against	 the  detenu.	It can be  revoked  suo	 motu  under
Section 11 or upon a representation of the detenu.  It seems
to  us	therefore,  that so long as  the  representation  is
independently  considered by the Government and if there  is
no  delay in considering the representation, the  fact	that
it  is considered after the confirmation of detention  makes
little	difference  on	the validity  of  the  detention  or
confirmation  of the detention.	 The confirmation cannot  be
invalidated solely on the ground that the representation  is
considered subsequent to confirmation of the detention.	 Nor
it  could  be  presumed that such consideration	 is  not  an
independent  consideration.   With all respect, we  are	 not
inclined  to subscribe to the views expressed in V.J.  Jain.
Om  Prakash  Bahl and Khairul Haque cases.  They  cannot  be
considered to be good law and hence stand overruled.",

Article 6,"Khoday Distilleries Ltd vs State Of Karnataka on 19 October, 1994",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/675008/?formInput=Article%206,,"8. Two incidental questions which, therefore, arise are
(i) whether a  monopoly	  for  the  manufacture,  trade	  or
business in liquor can be created in favour of the State and
(ii) whether reasonable restrictions under Article     19(6)
of the Constitution can be placed only by Act of Legislature
or by a	  subordinate legislation as well.
   9.  It is contended that the State cannot carry on  trade
in liquor under	 Article 47 of the Constitution. If the	 law
on the subject is considered to be law under Article  19(6),
it  has	 to  be	 on  the basis that  a	citizen	 had  got  a
fundamental  right to trade in liquor. If the law is that  a
citizen has no fundamental right, then Article 19(6)  cannot
be applied because the said   article applies only to  those
rights which a citizen possesses. What a citizen  cannot  do
under  Article	19(1),	the State cannot  do  under  Article
19(6).	  Secondly,  it is submitted that assuming that	 the
State has got the power to    carry   on  trade	 in   liquor
dehors	 Article  19(6)	 and  under  Article  298   of	 the
Constitution,  the power under Article 298 cannot extend  to
trade in liquor.    This is so because the Union  Government
has no executive power to trade in	a  commodity   which
under Article 47 it is enjoined to prohibit.



""301.	Freedom of trade, commerce and	intercourse.-Subject
to  the other provisions of this part, trade,  commerce	 and
intercourse  throughout	 the  territory of  India  shall  be
free.""
The  right given by this article to freely carry  on  trade,
commerce and  intercourse throughout the territory of  India
is  undisputedly subject to the same restrictions as is	 the
right under Article 19(1)(g).
584
17.Apart  from	the restrictions placed on the	right  under
Article	 301, by the provisions of Articles 19(6),  47,	 302
and  303,  the	provisions of Article 304  also	 place	such
restrictions  on  the said right.  So do the  provisions  of
Article	 305, so far as they protect existing laws and	laws
creating State monopolies.  The provisions of the  aforesaid
articles, so far as they are relevant for our purpose,	read
together, therefore, make the position clear that the  right
conferred  by  Article	19(1)(g) is  not  absolute.   It  is
subject	 to restrictions imposed by the other provisions  of
the   Constitution.   Those  provisions	 are  contained	  in
Articles 19(6), 47, 302, 303, 304 and 305.



53.  The  aforesaid  decisions pertaining to  the  trade  or
business in denatured spirit or industrial alcohol, not only
do  not	 take the view that the citizen	 has  a	 fundamental
right  to carry on trade or business in potable alcohol	 but
on  the contrary, hold that he has no such right.   This  is
reiterated in the two Synthetics & Chemicals cases29 and 30.
54.  It	 will thus be obvious that all the decisions  except
the decision in K.K. Narula case17 have unanimously held  as
shown  above that there is no fundamental right to carry  on
trade or business in potable liquor sold as a beverage.	  As
pointed out above, the proposition of law which is put in  a
different language in K.K. Narula case17 has been  explained
by the subsequent decisions of this Court including those of
the Constitution Benches.  The proposition of law laid	down
there has to be read in conformity with the proposition laid
down  in that respect by the other decisions of	 this  Court
not only to bring comity in the judicial decisions but	also
to  bring the law in conformity with the provisions  of	 the
Constitution.	The  fundamental  rights  conferred  by	 our
Constitution are not absolute.	Article 19 has to be read as
a  whole.  The fundamental rights enumerated  under  Article
19(1)  are subject to the restrictions mentioned in  clauses
(2)  to (6) of the said article.  Hence, the correct way  to
describe  the fundamental rights under Article 19(1)  is  to
call  them  qualified fundamental rights.  To  explain	this
position  in  law, we may take the same illustration  as  is
given in K. K. Narula case 17. The citizen has undoubtedly a
fundamental right to carry on business in ghee.	 But he	 has
no fundamental right to do business in adulterated ghee.  To
expound	 the  theme  further,  a citizen  has  no  right  to
trafficking in women or in slaves or in counterfeit coins or
to   carry   on	 business  of  exhibiting   and	  publishing
pornographic   or   obscene  films  and	  literature.	 The
illustrations  can be multiplied.  This is so because  there
are  certain  activities which are  inherently	vicious	 and
pernicious  and are condemned by all civilised	communities.
So  also, there are goods, articles and services  which	 are
obnoxious  and injurious to the health, morals,	 safety	 and
welfare	 of  the  general public.  To  contend	that  merely
because some

activities and trafficking in some goods can be organised as
a trade or business, right to carry on trade or business  in
the same should be considered a fundamental right is to	 beg
the  question.	The correct interpretation to be  placed  on
the expression ""the right to practise any profession, or  to
carry on any occupation, trade or business"" is to  interpret
it to mean the right to practise any profession or to  carry
on   any  occupation,  trade  or  business  which   can	  be
legitimately  pursued  in  a  civilised	 society  being	 not
abhorrent  to  the  generally  accepted	 standards  of	 its
morality.   Human perversity knows no limits and it  is	 not
possible  to enumerate all professions, occupations,  trades
and  businesses which may be obnoxious to  decency,  morals,
health,	 safety and welfare of the society.  This  is  apart
from  the  fact	 that under  our  Constitution	the  implied
restrictions  on the right to practise any profession or  to
carry on any occupation, trade or business are made explicit
in clauses (2) to (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution	 and
the  State  is permitted to make law for imposing  the	said
restrictions.  In the present case, it will be clause (6) of
Article	 19  which places restrictions	on  the	 fundamental
right	to  do	business  under	 Article  19(1)(g).    These
restrictions  and  limitations	on  fundamental	 right	 are
implicit  and inherent even in the fundamental rights  spelt
out  in	 the American Constitution, although  they  are	 not
explicitly  stated as in our Constitution by clauses (2)  to
(6)  of Article 19.  That is how the American Supreme  Court
has  read  and	interpreted  the  rights  in  the   American
Constitution  as pointed out above by the excerpts from	 the
relevant  decisions.   It will have, therefore, to  be	held
that  even  under  the American Constitution,  there  is  no
absolute  fundamental right to do business or trade  in	 any
commodity  or service.	The correct way, therefore, to	read
the fundamental rights enumerated under Article 19(1) of our
Constitution is to hold that the citizens do not possess the
said  rights  absolutely.   They have  the  said  rights  as
qualified  by the respective clauses (2) to (6)	 of  Article



63.  One  of the incidental contentions, viz.,	whether	 the
State  can create monopoly in trade or business	 in  potable
liquor	is already answered above.  This is apart  from	 the
fact that Article 19(6) provides for such monopoly in favour
of  the	 State	even  in trades	 and  businesses  which	 are
legitimate.  It is not, therefore, necessary to dilate	upon
this aspect any further.
64.  The  last	contention  in these groups  of	 matters  is
whether	 the State, can place restrictions  and	 limitations
under  Article	19(6) by subordinate  legislation.   Article
13(3)(a)  of the Constitution states that law includes	""any
ordinance,  order, bye-law, rule, regulation,  notification,
custom	or usage having in the territory of India the  force
of  law"".   Clauses  (2)  to (6)  of  Article,	19  make  no
distinction between the law made by the legislature and	 the
subordinate  legislation  for  the purpose  of	placing	 the
restrictions  on the exercise of the respective	 fundamental
rights	mentioned  in  Article	19(1)(a)  to  (g).   We	 are
concerned in the present case with clause (6) of Article 19.
It will be apparent from the said clause that it only speaks
of ""operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes ...""",
Article 6,"Society For Un-Aided P.School Of Raj vs U.O.I & Anr on 12 April, 2012",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/154958944/?formInput=Article%206,,"10.    Coming to the principle of reasonableness,  it  may  be  stated,
    that though subject-wise, Article 21A deals with access to education as
    against right to establish and administer  educational  institution  in
    Article 19(1)(g), it is now not open to anyone to contend that the  law
    relating to right to access education within Article 21A does not  have
    to  meet  the  requirement  of  Article  14  or  Article  19  for   its
    reasonableness.  [See Khudiram Das v. State of West Bengal reported  in
    (1975) 2 SCR 832]  After the judgment of this Court in Maneka Gandhi v.
    Union of India [(1978) 1 SCC 248], the principle of  reasonableness  is
    applicable to Article 14 of the Constitution. As held by this Court in
    Glanrock Estate Private Limited v. State of Tamil Nadu [(2010)  10  SCC
    96], Article 21 (right to life) remains the core  of  the  Constitution
    around which Article 14, Article  19  and  others  revolve.   In  other
    words, all other fundamental rights in Part III would be dependent upon
    right to life in Article 21 as interpreted by  this  Court  to  include
    right to live with dignity, right to education, etc.  At the end of the
    day, whether one adopts the pith and substance test or the  nature  and
    character of the legislation test or the effect test,  one  finds  that
    all these tests have evolved as  rules  of  interpretation  only  as  a
    matter of reasonableness. They help us to correlate  Article  21  with
    Article 14, Article 19 and, so on.  Applying  the  above  principle  of
    reasonableness, though the right to access education falls as a subject
    matter under Article 21A and though  to  implement  the  said  Article,
    Parliament has enacted the 2009 Act, one has to judge the  validity  of
    the said Act in the light of the principle of reasonableness in Article
    19(6), particularly, when in T.M.A. Pai Foundation and in P.A.  Inamdar
    v. State of Maharashtra [(2005) 6 SCC 537], it has been held that right
    to establish and administer  an  educational  institution  falls  under
    Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.  Thus, the question which  arises
    for determination is – whether Section 12(1)(c) of the 2009  Act  is  a
    reasonable restriction on the non-minority’s  right  to  establish  and
    administer an unaided  educational  institution  under  Article  19(6)?
Article 21 says that “no person shall be deprived of his  life...except
    according to the procedure established by law” whereas Article 19(1)(g)
    under the chapter “right to freedom” says that all  citizens  have  the
    right to practice any profession or to carry on any  occupation,  trade
    or business which freedom is not absolute but which could be  subjected
    to social control under  Article  19(6)  in  the  interest  of  general
    public.  By judicial decisions, right to education has been  read  into
    right to life in Article 21.  A child who is  denied  right  to  access
    education is not only deprived of his right to live with dignity, he is
    also deprived  of  his  right  to  freedom  of  speech  and  expression
    enshrined in Article 19(1)(a).  The 2009 Act seeks to remove all  those
    barriers including financial and psychological barriers which  a  child
    belonging to the weaker section and disadvantaged  group  has  to  face
    while seeking admission.  It is  true  that,  as  held  in  T.M.A.  Pai
    Foundation as  well  as  P.A.  Inamdar,  the  right  to  establish  and
    administer an educational institution is a fundamental right,  as  long
    as the activity remains charitable under Article 19(1)(g), however,  in
    the said two decisions the correlation between Articles 21 and 21A,  on
    the one hand, and  Article  19(1)(g),  on  the  other,  was  not  under
    consideration.  Further, the content of Article 21A flows from  Article
    45 (as it then stood).  The 2009 Act has been enacted to give effect to
    Article 21A.  For the above reasons, since the Article  19(1)(g)  right
    is not an absolute right as Article  30(1),  the  2009  Act  cannot  be
    termed as unreasonable.  To put  an  obligation  on  the  unaided  non-
    minority school to admit 25% children in class I under Section 12(1)(c)
    cannot be termed as an unreasonable restriction.  Such a law cannot  be
    said to transgress any constitutional limitation.  The  object  of  the
    2009 Act is to remove the barriers faced by a child who seeks admission
    to class I and not to restrict the freedom under Article 19(1)(g).  The
    next question that  arises  for  determination  is  –  whether  Section
    12(1)(c) of the 2009 Act impedes  the  right  of  the  non-minority  to
    establish and administer an unaided educational  institution?   At  the
    outset, it may be noted that Article 19(6) is  a  saving  and  enabling
    provision in the Constitution as it empowers the Parliament to  make  a
    law imposing reasonable restriction on the Article  19(1)(g)  right  to
    establish and administer an educational institution while  Article  21A
    empowers the Parliament to enact a law as to the manner  in  which  the
    State will discharge its obligation to provide for free and  compulsory
    education.  If the Parliament enacts the law, pursuant to Article  21A,
    enabling the State to access the network (including infrastructure)  of
    schools including unaided non-minority schools would such a law be said
    to be unconstitutional, not saved under Article 19(6)?   Answer  is  in
    the negative.  Firstly, it must be noted that the expansive  provisions
    of the 2009 Act are intended not only to guarantee the  right  to  free
    and compulsory education to children, but to set up an intrinsic regime
    of providing right to  education  to  all  children  by  providing  the
    required  infrastructure  and  compliance  of  norms   and   standards.
    Secondly, unlike other  fundamental  rights,  the  right  to  education
    places a burden not only on the State, but also on the parent/ guardian
    of every child [Article 51A(k)].  The Constitution directs both burdens
    to achieve one end: the compulsory education of children free from  the
    barriers of  cost,  parental  obstruction  or  State  inaction.   Thus,
    Articles 21A and 51A(k) balance the relative burdens on the parents and
    the State.   Thus,  the  right  to  education  envisages  a  reciprocal
    agreement  between  the  State  and  the  parents  and  it  places   an
    affirmative burden on all stakeholders in our civil society.   Thirdly,
    right to establish an educational institution has now  been  recognized
    as a fundamental right within the meaning of  Article  19(1)(g).   This
    view is enforced by the opinion of this Court in T.M.A. Pai  Foundation
    and P.A. Inamdar that all  citizens  have  a  right  to  establish  and
    administer educational institutions under Articles 19(1)(g) and 26  but
    that right is subject to the provisions of Articles  19(6)  and  26(a).
    The constitutional obligation of the State  to  provide  for  free  and
    compulsory education to the  specified  category  of  children  is  co-
    extensive with the fundamental right guaranteed under Article  19(1)(g)
    to establish an educational institution.  Lastly, the fundamental right
    to establish an educational institution cannot  be  confused  with  the
    right to ask  for  recognition  or  affiliation.   The  exercise  of  a
    fundamental  right  to  establish   and   administer   an   educational
    institution can be controlled in a number  of  ways.   Indeed,  matters
    relating to the right to grant of recognition and/ or  affiliation  are
    covered within the realm of statutory right, which, however, will  have
    to satisfy the test of reasonable  restrictions  [see  Article  19(6)].
    Thus, from the scheme of Article 21A and the 2009 Act, it is clear that
    the primary obligation  is  of  the  State  to  provide  for  free  and
    compulsory education to children between the age of 6 to 14 years  and,
    particularly, to children who are likely to be prevented from  pursuing
    and completing the elementary education due to inability to afford fees
    or charges.  Correspondingly, every citizen has a  right  to  establish
    and administer educational institution under Article 19(1)(g)  so  long
    as the activity remains charitable.  Such an activity undertaken by the
    private institutions supplements the primary obligation of  the  State.
    Thus, the State can regulate by  law  the  activities  of  the  private
    institutions by imposing reasonable restrictions under  Article  19(6).
    The 2009 Act not only encompasses the aspects of right of  children  to
    free and compulsory education but to carry out the  provisions  of  the
    2009 Act, it also deals with the matters pertaining to establishment of
    school (s) as also grant of recognition (see section 18).  Thus,  after
    the commencement of the 2009 Act, the private management  intending  to
    establish the school has to make  an  application  to  the  appropriate
    authority and till the certificate is granted  by  that  authority,  it
    cannot establish or run the school.  The matters relevant for the grant
    of recognition are also provided for in Sections 19, 25 read  with  the
    Schedule to the Act.  Thus, after the commencement of the 2009 Act,  by
    virtue of Section 12(1)(c) read with Section 2(n)(iv), the State, while
    granting recognition to the private unaided  non-minority  school,  may
    specify permissible  percentage  of  the  seats  to  be  earmarked  for
    children who may not be in a position to pay their fees or charges.  In
    T.M.A. Pai Foundation, this Court vide para 53 has  observed  that  the
    State while prescribing  qualifications  for  admission  in  a  private
    unaided institution may provide for condition of  giving  admission  to
    small percentage of  students  belonging  to  weaker  sections  of  the
    society by giving them freeships, if not  granted  by  the  government.
    Applying the said law, such a condition  in  Section  12(1)(c)  imposed
    while granting recognition to the private unaided  non-minority  school
    cannot be termed as unreasonable.  Such a condition would  come  within
    the principle of reasonableness in Article 19(6).  Indeed, by virtue of
    Section 12(2) read with Section 2(n)(iv), private unaided school  would
    be entitled to be reimbursed with the expenditure  incurred  by  it  in
    providing free and compulsory education to children  belonging  to  the
    above category to the extent of per child expenditure incurred  by  the
    State in a school specified in Section 2(n)(i)  or  the  actual  amount
    charged from the child, whichever is less.  Such a  restriction  is  in
    the  interest  of  the  general  public.   It  is  also  a   reasonable
    restriction.  Such measures address two aspects,  viz.,  upholding  the
    fundamental right of the private management  to  establish  an  unaided
    educational institution of their choice and, at the same time, securing
    the interests of the children in the locality, in particular, those who
    may not be able to pursue education due to inability  to  pay  fees  or
    charges of the private unaided schools. We also do not see any merit in
    the contention that Section 12(1)(c) violates Article  14.  As  stated,
    Section 12(1)(c) inter alia provides for admission to class I,  to  the
    extent of 25% of the strength of the class, of the  children  belonging
    to weaker section and disadvantaged  group  in  the  neighbourhood  and
    provide free and compulsory  elementary  education  to  them  till  its
    completion.  The  emphasis  is  on  “free  and  compulsory  education”.
    Earmarking of seats for children belonging to a specified category  who
    face financial barrier in the matter of accessing  education  satisfies
    the test of classification in Article  14.  Further,  Section  12(1)(c)
    provides for level playing field in the matter of right to education to
    children who are prevented from accessing education because they do not
    have the means or their parents do not have the means to pay for  their
    fees. As stated above, education  is  an  activity  in  which  we  have
    several participants. There are number of stakeholders including  those
    who want to establish and administer educational institutions as  these
    supplement the primary obligation of the State to provide for free  and
    compulsory education to the  specified  category  of  children.  Hence,
    Section 12(1)(c) also satisfies the test of reasonableness, apart  from
    the test of classification in Article 14.



    48.      Right to work does not oblige the State to  provide  work  for
    livelihood which has also been not recognized as a  fundamental  right.
    Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 (Act 42 of
    2005) guarantees at least 100 days of work in every financial  year  to
    every household whose adult members volunteer manual work on payment of
    minimum wages.  Article 41 of  the  Constitution  provides  that  State
    shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make
    effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to
    public assistance in cases  of  unemployment,  old  age,  sickness  and
    disablement, which right is also reflected  in  Article 6  of  ICESCR.
    Article 38 of Part-IV states that the State shall strive to promote the
    welfare of the people and Article 43 states that it shall endeavour  to
    secure a living wage and a decent standard of life to all workers.   In
    Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Others [(1984) 3 SCC 161], a
    Public Interest Litigation, an NGO highlighted the deplorable condition
    of bonded labourers in a quarry in Haryana.  It was pointed out that  a
    host of protective and welfare oriented labour legislations,  including
    Bonded Labour (Abolition) Act, 1976 and the Minimum Wages Act, 1948were
    not  followed.   This  Court  gave  various  directions  to  the  State
    Government to enable it  to  discharge  its  constitutional  obligation
    towards bonded labourers.  This Court held  that  right  to  live  with
    human dignity enshrined in Article 21 derives its life breath from  the
    Directive Principles of State Policy, particularly clauses (e) and  (f)
    of Article 39 and Articles 41 and 42 and  held  that  it  must  include
    protection of the health and strength of workers, men and women and  of
    the tender age of children against abuse, opportunities and  facilities
    for children to develop in  a  healthy  manner  and  in  conditions  of
    freedom and dignity, educational facilities, just and humane conditions
    of work and maternity relief.



 65.       Article 19(6)(i) enables the State to make  law  relating  to
    professional or technical qualifications necessary for  practicing  any
    profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.  Such laws
    can  prevent  unlicensed,  uncertified   medical   practitioners   from
    jeopardizing life and health of people.  Sub  clause  (ii)  to  Article
    19(6) imposes no limits upon  the  power  of  the  State  to  create  a
    monopoly in its favour.  State can also by law  nationalize  industries
    in the interest of general public.  Clause (6)(ii) of Article 19 serves
    as an exception to clause (1)(g) of Article 19 which enable  the  State
    to enact several legislations in nationalizing trades  and  industries.
    Reference may be made to Chapter-4 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1938, The
    Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1970,
    General Insurance Business (Nationalization) Act, 1972 and so on.  Sub-
    clause 6(ii) of Article 19 exempts the  State,  on  the  conditions  of
    reasonableness, by laying down that carrying out any  trade,  business,
    industry or services by the State Government would not be  questionable
    on the ground that it is an infringement on the right guaranteed  under
    Article 19(1)(g).



 74.       Referring to Pai Foundation  case,  the  Court  also  stated,
    having allowed the private sector into the field of education including
    higher education, it would be unreasonable, pursuant to clause  (6)  of
    Article 19, for the State to fix the fees and also impose  reservations
    on private unaided educational institutions.  Nevertheless,  the  Court
    opined that taking into consideration the width of the original  powers
    under Clause (6) of Article 19, one would necessarily have to find  the
    State would at least have the power to  make  amendments  to  resurrect
    some of those powers that it had possessed to  control  the  access  to
    higher education and achieve the goals  of  egalitarianism  and  social
    justice.",

Article 7,"A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1857950/?formInput=Article%207,,"Article  22 (4) opens with a double negative.  Put in  a
positive  form	it will mean that a law which  provides	 for
preventive  detention for a period longer than three  months
shall  contain .a provision establishing an advisory  board,
(consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned  in
sub-clause (a)), and which has to report before the  expira-
tion of three months if in its opinion there was  sufficient
cause for such detention. This clause, if it stood by itself
and  without  the remaining provisions of article  22,	will
apply  both  to the Parliament and the	State  Legislatures.
The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even  though
the  advisory  board may be of the opinion  that  there	 was
sufficient cause for such detention, i.e., detention  beyond
the period of three months, still the detention is not to be
permitted  beyond the maximum period, if any, prescribed  by
Parliament under article 22 (7) (b). Again the whole of this
sub-clause  is	made inoperative by article 22	(4)  (b)  in
respect of an Act of preventive detention passed by  Parlia-
ment  under clauses (7) (a) .and (b).  Inasmuch as  the	 im-
pugned	Act is an Act of the Parliament purported to  be  so
made, clause 22 (4) has no operation and may for the present
discussion  be kept aside. Article 22 prescribes  that	when
any person under a preventive detention law is detained, the
authority making the order shall, as soon as may be,  commu-
nicate	to such person the grounds on which . the order	 has
been made and shall afford him the

earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.	This  clause is of general operation in	 respect  of
every  detention order made under any law permitting  deten-
tion.  Article 22 (6) permits the authority making the order
to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid-
ers  against  the public interest to disclose.	 It  may  be
noticed that this clause only permits the non-disclosure  of
facts,	and reading clauses (5) and (6) together a  distinc-
tion  is  drawn	 between facts	and  grounds  of  detention.
Article 22 (4) and (7) deal not with the period of detention
only  but with other requirements in the case of  preventive
detention  also.  They provide for the establishment  of  an
advisory  board, and the necessity of furnishing grounds  to
the detenue and also to give him a right to make a represen-
tation.	 Reading article 22 clauses (4) and (7) together  it
appears	 to  be implied that preventive detention  for	less
than three months, without  an advisory board, is  permitted
under  the  Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights,  provided	such
legislation  is	 within the legislative	 competence  of	 the
Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be.
    Article  22	 (5) permits the detained person to  make  a
representation.	 The Constitution is silent as to the person
to  whom it has to be made, or how it has to be dealt  with.
But that is the procedure laid down by the Constitution.  It
does not therefore mean that if a law made by the Parliament
in  respect of preventive detention does not make  provision
on those two points it is invalid.  Silence on these  points
does  not  make	 the impugned Act in  contravention  of	 the
Constitution  because  the first question is  what  are	 the
rights	given by the Constitution in the case of  preventive
detention. The contention that the representation should  be
to  an	outside	 body has no support in law.   Even  in	 the
Liversidge  case  the representation had to be made  to	 the
Secretary  of  State and not to another	 body.	 After	such
representation	was  made,  another advisory  board  had  to
consider it, but it was not necessary to make the  represen-
tation	itself	to a third party.  Article 22  (4)  and	 (7)
permit the non-establishment of an advisory board  expressly
in a  parliamentary  legislation-



    It	was argued that section 11 of the impugned  Act	 was
invalid as it permitted the continuance of the detention for
such  period as the Central Government or the State  Govern-
ment thought fit.  This may mean an indefinite period. In my
opinion this argument has nos substance because the Act	 has
to  be read as a whole., The whole life of the Act is for  a
year  and therefore the argument that the detention  may  be
for  an indefinite period is unsound.  Again, by  virtue  of
article 22 (7)(b), the Parliament is not obliged to fix	 the
maximum	 term  of such detention.  It has not so  fixed	 it,
except	under section 12, and therefore it cannot be  stated
that section 11 is in contravention of article 22 (7).
Section  12	 of the impugned Act is	 challenged  on	 the
ground that it does not conform to the provisions of article
22 (7).	 It is argued that article 22 (7) permits preventive
detention  beyond  three months, when  the  Parliament	pre-
scribes ""the circumstances in which, and the class or class-
es  of	cases in which,"" a person may be detained.   It	 was
argued that both these conditions must be fulfilled.  In  my
opinion, this argument is unsound, because the words used in
article	 22 (7) themselves are against such  interpretation.
The  use of the word ""which"" twice in the first part of	 the
sub-clause,  read with the comma put after each, shows	that
the  legislature wanted these to be read as disjunctive	 and
not  conjunctive.   Such argument might have  been  possible
(though	 not  necessarily accepted) if' the article  in	 the
Constitution was ""the circumstances. and the class or class-
es of cases in which  ......  ""I have. no doubt that by	 the
clause, as worded, the legislature-



    Dealing with the four fundamental principles of  natural
justice	 in procedure claimed by the petitioner, it is	thus
clear that in respect of preventive detention no question of
an objective standard of human conduct can be laid down.  It
is  conceded that no notice before detention can be  claimed
by  the	 very nature of such detention.	 The  argument	that
after  detention intimation of the grounds should  be  given
has  been recognised in article 22 (5) and  incorporated  in
the	impugned   Act.	 As regards an	impartial  tribunal,
article	 22 and	 (7)  read  together give  the	  Parliament
ample  discretion.   When  in  specified  circumstances	 and
classes	 of cases the preventive  detention  exceeds   three
months,	 the absence of an advisory board is expressly	per-
mitted

by  article 22 (7). Under article 22 (4) it appears  implied
that  a provision for such tribunal is not necessary if	 the
detention  is  for less than three months.   As	 regards  an
opportunity to be heard, there is no absolute natural  right
recognised  in respect of oral representation.	It has	been
held  to depend on the nature of the tribunal. The right  to
make  a	 representation is affirmed by the  Constitution  in
article	 22 (5) and finds a place in the impugned Act.	 The
right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it  is
guaranteed  by article 22 (4) read with article 22 (7)	(c),
and  by	 article  22  (7) (a) and (b), has  also  been	thus
provided   in  the  Act.   It seems to me therefore that the
petitioner's contentions even on these points fail.
    Section  14 was strongly attacked on the ground that  it
violated  all  principles of natural justice  and  even	 in-
fringed	 the right given by article 22 (5) of the  Constitu-
tion.  It runs as follows:



    It will be noticed that all the subjects of	 legislation
concerning preventive detention occurring in item    of List
I are grouped in sub-clause (1) of clause (a). The  subjects
in  this group are three in number and, for  convenience  of
reference,  I shall hereafter refer to them as A, B  and  C.
In  sub-.clause	 (ii), we find grouped two  of	the  matters
referred  to in item 3 of List III, these being security  of
the  State and the maintenance of public order.	  These	 two
subjects, I shall refer to as D and E. In sub-clause  (iii),
reference  has	been made to the third matter in item  3  of
List III, and I shall refer to this subject as F.  With this
classification, let us now turn to the Constitution itself.
    On reading articles 22 (4) and 22 (7) together, it would
be clear that so long as article 22 (4) (a) holds the  field
and Parliament does not act under clause (7) (a) of  article
22, there must be an advisory board in every case, i.e.,  if
the  legislation relates to groups A to F, as it does  here,
there must be an advisory board for all these groups.
    Article  22 (7) however practically engrafts  an  excep-
tion.  It states in substance that the Parliament may by  an
Act  provide  for preventive detention for more	 than  three
months	without reference to an advisory board, but in	such
cases  it shall be incumbent on the Parliament to  prescribe
(1) the circumstances and (2) the class or classes of  cases
in  which such course is found to be necessary. If the	case
contemplated  in clause (4)(a)is the rule and  that  contem-
plated 'in clause (7) (a) is the exception, then the circum-
stances	 and  the  class or classes of cases must  be  of  a
special or extraordinary nature, so as to take the case	 out
of the rule and bring it within the exception.	It is always

possible to draw the line between the normal or ordinary and
the  abnormal or  extraordinary cases. and this is what,  in
my opinion, the Parliament was	expected to do under  clause
(7)  (a).   I do not think that it was	ever  intended	that
Parliament could at its will treat the normal as the  abnor-
mal  or 'the rule as the exception.  But this  is  precisely
what  has  been done in this case-  All the items  on  which
preventive legislation is possible excepting one, i.e., A to
E,  have  been put within the exception, and  only  one,  F,
which relates to maintenance of supplies and services essen-
tial to the community, has been allowed to remain under	 the
rule. In other words, it is provided that there shall be  an
advisory board only for the last category, F, but no  provi-
sion  having been made for the other categories, A to E,  it
may  be assumed that the advisory board has  been  dispensed
with in those cases. The learned Attorney-General maintained
that  it would have been open to the Parliament to  dispense
with the advisory board even for the category F, and if such
a  course  had been adopted it would not have  affected	 the
validity of the Act.  This is undoubtedly a logical position
in  the sense that it was necessary for him to go as far  as
this  to justify his stand; but, in my opinion,	 the  course
adopted	 by  the Parliament in enacting section	 12  of	 the
impugned  Act is not what  is  contemplated  under   article
22 (7)	(a) or is permitted by it.  The	 circumstances to be
prescribed  must be special and extraordinary  circumstances
and  the class or classes of cases must be of the  same	 na-
ture.	In my opinion, the Constitution	 never	contemplated
that  the  Parliament should mechanically reproduce  all  or
most of the categories A to F almost verbatim and not  apply
its  mind to decide in what circumstances and in what  class
or classes of cases the safeguard of an advisory board is to
be dispensed with.",

defined in Article 12 (Royalties and Fees

Income Attributable to PE
16.	Under Article 7, the taxability is of the MNE. What is to 
be taxed under Article 7 is income of the MNE attributable to 
the P.E. in India. The income attributable to the said P.E. is 
the income attributable to foreign company's operations in 
India, which in term, implies the income attributable to the 
activities carried on by the MNE through its P.E. in India. 
Therefore, there is a difference between the taxability of the 
P.E. in respect of its income earned by it in India which is in 
accordance with the Income-Tax Act, 1961 and which has 
nothing to do with the taxability of the MNE, which is also 
taxable in India under Article 7, in respect of the profits 
attributable to its P.E.. Under Article 7, the taxability is of the 
MNE. What is taxable under Article 7 is profits earned by the 
MNE. Under the said IT Act, the taxable unit is the foreign 
company, though the quantum of income taxable is income 
attributable to the P.E. of the said foreign company in India.	



30.	To answer the above question we quote Article 7 of the 
U.N. Model Convention which reads as under:
""ARTICLE 7 :	ATTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS PROFITS

Article 7 of the UN Model Convention states as under:
business profits
1.	The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be 
taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on 
business in the other Contracting State through a 
permanent establishment situated therein.  If the 
enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of 
the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so 
much of them as is attributable to (a) that permanent 
establishment; (b) sales in that other State of goods or 
merchandise of the same or similar kind as those sold 
through that permanent establishment; or (c) other 
business activities carried on in that other State of the 
same or similar kind as those effected through that 
permanent establishment.  



31.	Article 7 of the U.N. Model Convention inter alia provides 
that only that portion of business profits is taxable in the 
source country which is attributable to the PE.  It specifies 
how such business profits should be ascertained.  Under the 
said Article, a PE is treated as if it is an independent 
enterprise (profit centre) dehors the head office and which 
deals with the head office at arm's length.  Therefore, its 
profits are determined on the basis as if it is an independent 
enterprise.  The profits of the PE are determined on the basis 
of what an independent enterprise under similar 
circumstances might be expected to derive on its own.  Article
7(2) of the U.N. Model Convention advocates the arm's length 
approach for attribution of profits to a PE.",

or/and whether all operations of the business are 
not carried out in India are questions of fact which 
have to be determined on the facts of each case.""  

	Applying the said principles to the facts of the present case, the 
Authority opined that the appellant was liable to pay direct tax even under 
the Treaty having regard to Articles 5 and 7 thereof as also Clause 6 of the 
Protocol.  It was held :

	""The substance of the protocol quoted above, 
represents the consensus reached between the parties to 
the treaty in regard to the meaning of the phrase ""directly 
or indirectly attributable to that permanent 
establishment"" employed in paragraph 1 of article 7.  
Further, profits shall also be regarded as attributable to 
the permanent establishment to the extent indicated in the 
said protocol even when the contract or order relating to 
the sale or provision of goods or services in question is 
made or placed directly with the overseas head office of 
the enterprise rather than with the permanent 
establishment.



	It would be clear that having regard to provisions 
of article 7(1) of the Treaty read with para 6 of the 
protocol supply of equipment of machinery (sale of 
which was completed abroad, having placed the order 
directly overseas office of the enterprise) the same should 
be within the meaning of the phrase directly or indirectly 
attributable to that permanent establishment.""      		

	As regards taxability of the amounts 'received' and 'receivable' by the 
appellant from Petronet for offshore services, it was held :



	5.	The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall 
not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties or fees 
for technical services, being a resident of a Contracting 
State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in 
which the royalties or fees for technical services arise, 
through a permanent establishment situated therein, or 
performs in that other Contracting State independent 
personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and 
the right, property or contract in respect of which the 
royalties or fees for technical services are paid is 
effectively connected with such permanent establishment 
or fixed base.  In such case, the provisions of article 7 or 
article 14, as the case may be, shall apply.""



(7)	Section 9(1)(vii)(c) of the Act in this case would have no application 
as there is nothing to show that the income derived by a non-resident 
company irrespective of where rendered, was utilized in India. 
(8)	Article 7 of the DTAA is applicable in this case, and it limits the tax 
on business profits to that arising from the operations of the 
permanent establishment. In this case, the entire services have been 
rendered outside India, and have nothing to do with the permanent 
establishment, and can thus not be attributable to the permanent 
establishment and therefore not taxable in India.
(9)	Applying the principle of apportionment to composite transactions 
which have some operations in one territory and some in others, is 
essential to determine the taxability of various operations.
(10)	The location of the source of income within India would not render 
	sufficient nexus to tax the income from that source. 
(11)	If the test applied by the Authority for Advanced Rulings is to be 
adopted here too, then it would eliminate the difference between the 
connection between Indian and foreign operations, and the 
apportionment of income accordingly.",
Article 7,"Gujarat State Financial Corporation vs M/S. Natson Manufacturing Co. (P) Ltd. & ... on 29 August, 1978",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1961081/?formInput=Article%207,,"The state of Gujarat set up the Gujarat state Financial
corporation ('Corporation' for short), the appellant herein,
under s. 3 of the Act. The Corporation was set up inter alia
for granting  or guaranteeing  tile loans  to be  raised  by
industrial concerns either from scheduled banks or state co-
operative banks	 or those  floated in the public market. The
Corporation guaranteed	numerous such loans, advanced to the
industrial concerns in the state of Gujarat on certain terms
and  conditions	  agreed  between   the	 parties.  When	 the
industrial concern defaults in repayment of loan or fails to
comply with  the terms	of the	agreement the Corporation is
entitled to make an application to the District Judge within
the limits  of whose  jurisdiction  the	 industrial  concern
carries on the whole or substantial part of its business for
one or	more of	 the reliefs set out in s. 31(1) of the Act.
The  Corporation   appears  to	 have,	 made	applications
purporting to  be under	 s. 31(1)  of  the  Act	 in  various
District Courts	 in the	 State of  Gujarat against different
industrial concerns.  A question  was raised in the District
Courts	about	the  proper   court  fee   payable  on	such
applications. The Corporation contended that the application
would be  governed by Article 1 (of Schedule II o the Bombay
Court) Fee Act, 1959, and a fixed court fee in the amount of
65 paise  would be payable in respect of the application. On
the other  hand, the  State contended that application would
be governed either by

Article I   Schedule  I or  at any  rate  by  Article 7  of
Schedule I  and the court fee payable would be ad valorem on
the amount  of value  of the subject matter in dispute or on
the amount  of the  monetary gain  or loss  to be  prevented
according  to  the  scale  prescribed  under  Article  I  of
Schedule I.  It appears	 that except  for the  Distt. Judge,
Broach, all other District Judges accepted the contention on
behalf of  the State.  The Distt.  Judge, Broach  was of the
opinion that  the application  under s.	 31(1)	was  in	 the
nature of  an execution application and it would be governed
by Article  l(c) of  Schedule II.  The Corporation preferred
revision applications  to the  High  Court  questioning	 the
correctness of	the decisions  directing levy  of ad valorem
court fee.  The State  of Gujarat  also preferred a revision
application against the decision of the Distt. Judge, Broach
holding that  the application under s. 31 (1) of the Act was
in the nature of an execution application. The High Court by
a common  judgment held that the application under s. 31 (1)
should	bear   ad  valorem   court  fee.  In  reaching	this
conclusion the	High Court  treated the application under s.



378
 Article 1	of Schedule I of the Court-fees Act provides
for ad	valorem court  fee on plaint or memorandum of appeal
(not otherwise	provided  for  in  the	Act)  or  of  cross-
objections presented  to any  civil or	revenue court, to be
levied according to the scale set out in the Schedule on the
value of  the subject-matter  in dispute. Article 7 provides
for court-fees	on a plaint or application or petition other
than those  provided  in  the  earlier	Articles  to  obtain
substantive relief  capable of	being  valued  in  terms  of
monetary gain or prevention of monetary loss including cases
where an  application or  petition is  treated either  as  a
plaint or a described as the mode of obtaining the relief as
aforesaid, the	fee to	be calculated  on the  amount of the
monetary gain  or monetary loss to be prevented according to
the scale prescribed under Article 1.



     It was  said that	if cause  is shown by the industrial
concern	 it   is  obligatory   upon  the   Distt.  Judge  to
investigate  the  claim	 of  the  Financial  Corporation  in
accordance with the provision contained in the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908, in so far as such provisions may be applied
thereto. The  contention is  that once an industrial concern
shows cause  and contests the application of the Corporation
there arises  a lis  between the parties which would include
the investigation  of the  monetary claim of the Corporation
and per	 se it would be a suit between the mortgagee and the
mortgagor in  which the ultimate relief is sale of mortgaged
property for  repayment of the mortgage money. Sub-s. (6) of
s. 32  of the  Act has to be read in the context in which it
is placed.  The claim of the Corporation is not the monetary
claim to be investigated though it may become necessary to

specify the  figure for	 the purpose of determining how much
of the security should be sold. But the investigation of the
claim does  not involve	 all the  contentions  that  can  be
raised in a suit. The claim of the Corporation is that there
is a  breach of	 agreement or default in making repayment of
loan or	 advance or  instalment thereof	 and, therefore, the
mortgaged property  should be sold. It is not a money claim.
The contest  can  be  that  the	 jurisdictional	 fact  which
enables the  Corporation to  seek  the	relief	of  sale  of
property is  not available  to it or no case is made out for
transfer of management of the industrial concern. Sub-s. (7)
of  s.	32  prescribes	what  reliefs  can  be	given  after
investigation under sub-s. (6) is made, and it clearly gives
a clue to the nature of contest under Sub-s. (6). Sub-s. (8)
of s.  32 only	prescribes the mode and method for executing
the order  of attachment  or sale of property as provided in
the Code  of Civil Procedure. Sub-ss. (6), (7) and (8) of s.
32 read together would give an opportunity to the industrial
concern to  appear and	satisfy the  District Judge what the
situation envisaged  by s.  31(13 has  not  arisen  and	 the
relief should  not be granted. In the absence of a provision
giving such  an opportunity  to the  industrial	 concern  to
whose detriment	 the order is required to be made, a serious
question may  arise about the constitutional validity of the
procedure prescribed  under s. 31(1) inasmuch as it would be
violative of principles of natural justice and that too in a
proceeding in  a Court	of Law.	 The provision	contained in
sub-s. (6)  does not  expand the  contest in the application
made under  s. 31(1)  as to  render the	 application to be a
suit between  a mortgagee,  and the  mortgagor for  sale  of
mortgaged property.  If that  were so, the Corporation would
not be limited to specified reliefs only and if the contract
permits	 it  may  seek	to  enforce  personal  liability  of
mortgage which	it cannot  enforce in  an application  under
Sec. 31	 ( 1). It may be, as contended by Mr. Patel, that in
the ultimate  analysis the result would be that the property
will be	 sold for  repayment of the loan or advance taken by
the, industrial	 concern from  the Corporation	but it could
not be	said that  it is a substantive relief claimed by the
Corporation which can be valued in terms of monetary gain or
prevention of  monetary loss  as envisaged  by Article 7 of
Schedule I  of Court-fees  Act. The substantive relief in an
application  under   s.	 31(1)	 is  something	akin  to  an
application for	 attachment of	property in  execution of  a
decree at a stage posterior to the passing of the decree. We
are unable  to appreciate  the view  taken by the High Court
that the  proceeding is	 not in the nature of execution of a
decree because	the question  of enforcement of the order of
attachment or  sale would  only arise after the same is made
absolute under	Sub-s. (7).  One has  to look  at the  whole
conspectus of provisions in s. 32 coupled with the nature of
relief sought under s. 31(1)

and it	becomes clear  that special  provision is  made	 for
certain	 types	 of  reliefs  that  can	 be  obtained  by  a
Corporation by an application under s. 31(1) which could not
be styled  as substantive  relief for  repayment of mortgage
money by  sale of  mortgaged property. Nor can it be said to
be a  proceeding to  obtain substantive	 relief	 capable  of
being valued  in terms	of monetary  gain or  prevention  of
monetary loss.	The form  of the  application, the nature of
the relief,  the  compulsion  to  make	interim	 order,	 the
limited enquiry	 contemplated by  Sub-s. 6  of s. 32 and the
nature of  relief that	can be	granted and  the  manner  of
execution clearly  show that  the application under s. 31(1)
is neither a plaint as contemplated by Article 1 of Schedule
I nor an application in a nature of a plaint as contemplated
by Article 7 of Schedule I of Court-fees Act.



     Once Article 7 of	 Schedule I of the Court-fees Act is
excluded there	was  (and  could  be)  no  dispute  that  an
application under  s. 31(1)  of the  Act would be covered by
the residuary  Article l(c) of Schedule II of the Court-fees
Act and	 it should  bear a  fixed court fee in the sum of 65
paise. Therefore,  the High  Court was	clearly in  error in
holding that  the application  should bear  ad valorem court
fee.
     When  dealing   with  a  question	of  court  fee,	 the
perspective should  be informed	 by the	 spirit of the magna
carta and  of equal  access to justice which suggests that a
heavy price  tag on  relief in	Court should  be regarded as
unpalatable.",

2. These civil appeals filed by the Department concern computation of the
profits of the Indian permanent establishment (for short, ""PE"") of the
Korean company, M/s .Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd. (for short, `HHi').
Assesses is a non-resident foreign company incorporated in South Korea. On
12.3.85 it had entered into an agreement with oil and Natural Gas Company
(for short, `ONGC') for designing, fabrication, hook-up and commissioning
of South Basin field Central Complex facilities in Bombay High. In short
the contract was in two parts, one was for fabrication of platform and the
other was installation and commissioning of the said platform in South
Basses in Field. In these civil appeals we are concerned with the
assessment years 1987-88 and 1988-89. The assesses is incorporated under
the laws of Republic of Korea. Its registered office is in Korea. As
regards assessment year 1988-89, assesses filed its return of income on
3.8.1988. The return indicated `nil' income. In response to notices under
Section 143(2) of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (for short `the Act'), the
assesses stated that it did not have a PE in India and, therefore, it was
not assessable to tax in India; that its Indian Operations consisting of
installation and commissioning of the platform commenced in the taxable
territory of India on 1.11.86 and got completed on 12.4.87 and, therefore,
the duration of the Project was less than nine months; that it was entitled
to exemption under Article 7 of the Convention for Avoidance of Double
Taxation (for short, `CADT'); that in the alternative it was liable to be
assessed on the basis of the accounts annexed to the returns; that the
accounts were based on the Completed Contract Method in its worldwide
accounts; that the accounts of its PE can be accepted in the Completed
Contract Method basis ; that it was maintaining income and expenditure
account of its PE in India; that the above contract was divisible into two
types of operations-one being fabrication in Korea and the other consisting
of installation in India and , therefore, any income arising from the
activity of fabrication in Korea was not assessable to tax in India and,
therefore, any income arising from the activity of fabrication in Korea was
not assessable to tax in India and to that extent the revenues receivable
under the above contract in respect of the activity of fabrication should
be excluded from the profit and loss account together with the expenditure
relating to the activity of fabrication. It was further contended that the
assesses had included the revenues relating to installation (Indian
Activity) in the profit and loss account and the expenditure relating to
that activity was debited on the Matching Principle Basis. It was further
contended that the profit and loss account consisted of two parts-the
Korean and the Indian part; that the Korean part recorded the entire
revenue/income received in Korea as also the expenditure incurred in Korea
relating to the Indian Project and debited to the Korean book of accounts.
All the above contentions were rejected by the A.O. it was held that the
duration of the Project consisting of installation and commissioning
extended beyond nine months, that the project constituted a PE of the
assessee in India in terms of Article 5(3) of CADT; that in any event the
office of HHI in Bombay constituted a PE under Article 5(2)(c), and
therefore, the claim of the assessee for exemption under Article 7 of the
CADT was not maintainable. Therefore, the profits attributable to the PE
were liable to be taxed in India in accordance with Article 7 of the CADT.
The A.O. also rejected the Completed Contract Method as well as the
accounts submitted by the assessee on the ground that the assessee had
failed to produce the relevant books of accounts in respect of the profit
and loss account; that they had refused to produce books of accounts
maintained in Korea; and that they had failed to produced the accounting
details pertaining to the activities/operations carried out by its PE in
India. For the said reasons the accounts were rejected by the A.O.
Therefore, the assessment was made for each of the two assessment years on
receipt basis. On the question of quantum of assessment, the A.O. held that
income from designing, fabrication, procurement of material etc. was partly
attributable to the PE of the assessee in India on the ground that
designing, fabrication and procurement of material were activities having
nexus/linkage to the ultimate activity of installation and commissioning of
platform in Bombay High and, therefore, income to that extent from the
Korean Operations was taxable in India. According to the A.O., the contract
was not divisible. According to the A.O., the contract was in respect of
the Turnkey Project; that the consideration in the contract was of lump sum
price; that even when the fabricated structure was delivered for
transportation to the representative of ONGC the accounts between the
parties remained to be settled; and since designing and fabrication of the
platform had an application in Bombay High, (where the platform was to be
come into operation), a part of the profits arising even from Korean
operations was taxable in India as such portion of the profits was
attributable to the work of installation and commissioning of the platform
in Bombay High. Accordingly the A.O. estimated the net profit of the
assessee under the contract at 20% of the gross receipts. Consequently, the
A.O. taxed the entire revenue relatable to the Indian Operations and he
taxed 2% of the contract revenue in respect of the Korean Operations.



9. Now, coming to the present case, the main argument advanced on behalf of
the Department was that the assessee was in receipt of consideration which
formed part of execution of Turnkey Project with ONGC; that there was one
integrated contract; that the contract was not divisible in terms of
separate activities and, therefore, the Tribunal had erred in holding that
profits accruing to the assessee from activities performed outside India
were not chargeable to tax in India. According to the Department, the work
of designing and fabrication under the Turnkey Project was totally
interlinked with installation and commissioning and, therefore, there was
no merit in the assessee's claim in respect of receipts attributable to the
activates performed outside India as not chargeable to tax in India.
According to the Department, the assessee was required to execute turnkey
work, that is, to supply certain equipments and install the same in India.
According to the Department, the supply of fabricated platform was
essentially linked to installation of the platform in the Bombay High.
Thus, according to the Department, there was a business connection and the
supplies were linked to the Project in Bombay High. For this reason,
according to the Department, the consideration received by the assessee for
supplies form outside India were taxable in India in terms of Section 9(1)
of the Act. On the other hand, the assessee placed reliance on Article 7 of
the CADT and submitted that on completion of the work of fabricated of
platforms the same were handed over to the Agents of the ONGC in Korea and,
therefore, the assessee was not liable to be taxed in respect of the
profits attributable to the operations of designing and fabrication in
Korea. In this connection, the assessee placed reliance on Article 7 of
CADT.



10. We quote hereinbelow Article 7 of CADT between Government of India and
Government of Korea which reads as under:

""ARTICLE 7 -Business profits-1. the profits of an enterprise of a
contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise
carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent
establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as
aforesaid the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but
only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.



5. For the purpose of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be
attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by he same
method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the
contrary.

6. Where income or profits include items of income which are dealt with
separately in other articles of this Convention, then the provisions of
those articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this article.""

11. On reading Article 7 of the CADT, it is clear that the said Article is
based on OECD Model Convention. Para (1) of Article 7 states the general
rule that business profits of an enterprise of one Contracting State may
not be taxed by the other Contracting State unless the enterprise carries
on its business in the Other Contracting State through its PE. The said
para 91) further lays down that only so much of the profits attributable to
the PE is taxable. Para 91) of Article 7 further lays down that the
attributable profit can be determined by the apportionment of the total
profits of the assessee to its various parts OR on the basis of an
assumption that the PE is a distinct and separate enterprise having its own
profits and distinct from GE. Applying the above test to the facts of the
present case, we find that profits earned by the Korean GE on supplies of
fabricated platforms cannot be made attributable to its Indian PE as the
installation PE came into existence only after the transaction stood
materialized. The installation PE came into existence only on conclusion of
the transaction giving rise to the supplies of the fabricated platforms.
The Installation PE emerged only after the contract with ONGC stood
concluded. It emerged only after the fabricated platform was delivered in
Korea to the Agents of ONGC. Therefore, the profits on such supplies of
fabricated platforms cannot be said to be attributable to the PE. There is
one more reason for coming to the aforestated conclusion. In terms of para
(1) of Article 7, the profits to be taxed in the source country were not
the real profits but hypothetical profits which the PE would have earned if
it was wholly independent of the GE. Therefore, even if we assume that the
supplies were necessary for the purposes of installation (activity of the
PE in India) and even if we assume that the supplies were an integral part,
still no part of profits on such supplies can be attributed to the
independent PE unless it is established by the Department that the supplies
were not at arm's length price. No such taxability can arise in the present
case as the sales were directly billed to the Indian Customer (ONGC). No
such taxability can also arise in the present case as there was no
allegation made by the Department that the price at which billing was done
for the supplies included any element for services rendered by the PE. In
the light of our above discussion, we are of the view that the profits that
accrued to the Korean GE for the Korean operations were not taxable in
India.",

At this stage, we may mention that the assessing officer in the assessment order had used the expression ""separate business"" in respect of the services rendered by the assessed to other airlines. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) the use of this expression was not apt, but (sic-by) further examining article 8 he held that para 3 of article 8 referred to certain activities which were preparatory or auxiliary to the main activity of transportation of passengers and cargo and these had also been exempted. He, therefore, held that the words ""separate business"" would mean such activities whose revenues were not exempt under article 8 from taxation in the source country. The Commissioner (Appeals) cited an example whereby an assessed operated aircraft in international traffic and also undertook number of other activities and there was a common management and financial set up in respect of all such activities. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) it could not be held that the whole of the profit of the enterprise would be exempt from tax in the source country under article 8 since only such profit would not be liable to be taxed under the said article as was derived from the activities mentioned therein and this would be true even when there was uniformity of control, management, finance and operations. According to the Commissioner (Appeals) there was nothing in article 8 which would lead to the conclusion that income derived from rendering services to other airlines was exempt from tax in the source country. In view of the aforesaid the Commissioner (Appeals) held that the income derived from rendering engineering services/ground handling services to aircraft of other airlines was not exempt vis-a-vis paras 1 and 3 of article 8 and the said revenues being a clear case of exploitation of excess activity through a permanent establishment the same were taxable in India. Dealing thereafter with the submissions of the assessed that its case was also covered under para 2 of the article i.e. participation in pools, the Commissioner (Appeals) referred to the Commentary on OECD Model by Klaus Vogel. The conclusions thereafter were as under :



(xiii) Similarly the concept of intention would not apply;

(xiv) The concept of ""same business"" had no relevance to the point at issue;

(xv) There were two kinds of profits-one defined in article 8 and the other in article 7 reliance was specifically placed on article 7(1), 7(2), 7(5) and 7(9);

(xvi) That vis-a-vis the aforesaid article it was the right of India to tax profits of the nature arising to the assessed;

(xvii) Article 8 (1) decided which state had a right to tax the profit/income, article 8(2) extended the scope of profit and article 8(3) extended the scope of the activity by including ""pools"" which generated profit;



(9) Exemption envisaged in article 8(1) was applicable to article 8(2) as well and there was no limit or ambiguity in article 8(2) as it mentioned pools of any kind and not necessarily profit earning pools;

(10) The revenue had considered that IATP was a pool and, therefore, article 8(1) applied to every kind of pool;

(11) In other treaties joint venture and pool were mentioned separately, but if both were to be considered as one and the same thing, then separate mention need not be there;

(12) Vis-a-vis article 9, sub-article (5) para 33 of the compilation pool was different then a joint venture;



61. We now come to article 8 itself with its separate clauses and on which have centered the arguments of both the parties.

62. Coming to article 8(1) there is no confusion or ambiguity since it exempts from the pale of taxation in a contracting state the profit earned by the enterprise of the other contracting state from the operation of aircraft in international traffic if the enterprise has effective management in the contracting state.

63. Article 8(2) in our opinion speaks of the same type of activity giving rise to profits earned by the enterprise participating in a pool for earning the profits derived from international traffic. In other words, what is done by an enterprise singly in article 1 is done by the same enterprise jointly with others by participating in a pool. We have in the earlier part of this order discussed at length the concept of ""Pools"" and nothing more is to be said so we move on to article 8(3).",
Article 8,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%208,,"27. I am also inclined to agree with sen and Chunder JJ. Vide  that Article 9 has obviously some reference to Section 178, Government of India Act where the same words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" occur, which reasonably suggests that Article 9, like the said Section 178, deals only with liabilities, connected with matters of revenue.

28. Indeed, it seems to me that the framers of Article 9 of the 1947 Order borrowed not only the phrase ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" from the corresponding Section 178, Government of India Act of 1935 which was then in force but also the broad scheme of that statute in the matter of the nature, scope and classification of contractual rights and liabilities of the State and a comparison of Ss. 177 and 178 of the Act of 1935 with Arts. 8 and 9 of the 1947 Order will show that, under both, State or Government contractual liabilities were grouped under two heads, namely, special contracts like loans, guarantees etc   and contracts in general.    The latter were dealt with in Section 177 and Article 8 and the former in the succeeding Section 178 and Article 9.   The opening words of Section 177(1), namely, ""without prejudice  to the  special provisions of the next succeeding section (Section 178) relating to loans, guarantees and other financial obligations,"" -- and  these words ""loans,   guarantees and other financial obligations"" which, in this Section 177, plainly refer to  certain special or excepted types of contractual liabilities obviously bear also the same sense in the succeeding Section 178, -- ""any contract etc."" and the opening words of Cl (6) of Article 8, namely, ""the provisions of this Article (Article 8)  shall have effect subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Order"", read in the light of the reference to ""any contract"" and ""all..... liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under 'the contract' or any such contract' "" in the earlier parts of the Article (Article 8), are sufficient to show that by the words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" were meant only contractual liabilities of some special type as distinguished from contractual liabilities in general, I do not think it is possible to contend, in view of the clear language of the two provisions (Section 177 and Article 8), that they purport to deal with any liability except contractual liability and, if that be so, the reservations, made in the quotations, set out above, must obviously refer to liabilities, arising out of certain transactions which are treated as special contracts at least for purposes of the above Act and Order.



45. The next point urged by the learned Assistant Government Pleader is that in view of the provisions of Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, the Province of East Bengal and not the Province of West Bengal is liable for the liability which was a liability of undivided Bengal before partition. The learned Subordinate Judge held in this connection that the liability of the Province of undivided Bengal to pay compensation for the requisitioned paddy amounted to a liability for actionable wrong and that therefore the liability had devolved upon the Province of West Bengal in view of Clause (2), Sub-clause (b) of Article 10, for the cause of action arose wholly within the territory of West Bengal, viz., in Midnapore District where the paddy was delivered after service of the requisition order. The learned Assistant Government Pleader has urged that Article 10 does not apply to the facts of the present case, because Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than a breach of contract, and since the paddy was requisitioned under the provisions of a statute, viz., Rule 75A of the Defence of India Rules, which had the same force as a section of the Defence of India Act. it cannot be said that there was any actionable wrong committed by the requisitioning and taking delivery of the paddy. The learned Assistant Government Pleader, therefore, urges that Article 7 will govern the case. But Article 7 clearly does not apply. It relates to property other than lands, goods, coins, bank notes, currency notes which immediately before the appointed day vested in His Majesty for the purposes of the Governor-General in Council or of a province. Article 7 relates to division of assets, and it relates to property other than lands, goods, coins, etc. In the present case, we are concerned with goods viz., paddy itself, but with the liability to pay compensation for the paddy. Articles 8 to 10 deal with distribution of liability. Article 8 relates to contractual liability. Liability to pay compensation for requisitioned goods is not a contractual liability but is a statutory liability, and therefore Article 8 is ruled out. Requisitioning of paddy being a legal act in pursuance of a statute cannot be regarded as an actionable wrong, and therefore, we are thrown back on Article 9 which relates to liabilities in respect of such loans, guarantees and other financial obligations of the Governor-General in Council or of a province as are outstanding immediately before the appointed, day. If the liability to pay compensation for the requisitioned goods comes within the terms 'other financial obligations', clearly Article 9 would be applicable, and in that case, the liability would be that of the province of East Bengal. It has been held by this Court that the term 'other financial obligations' should be interpreted as ejus-dem generis with loans and guarantees, ""vide the cases  and  In the first case, viz.,  the liability was in respect of rent for a house which had been taken on hire by the Government for running a hospital. It was urged before their Lordships Harries C. J. and Sarkar J. that the dueg upto the date of partition were 'other financial obligations' coming within the terms of Article 9, Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, and therefore the Government of East Bengal would be liable. Their Lordships, however, held that the obligations to pay rent for the house arose out of a contract and it was therefore purely a contractual obligation covered by Article 8, and did not fall within 'other financial obligations' in Article 9. In delivering the judgment, Harries C. J. observed as follows:



59. The Indian Independence (Rights, property and Liabilities) Order was promulgated by the Governor-General of British India under powers conferred on him by Section 9 (1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 for making an initial distribution of the assets and liabilities of undivided India and undivided Provinces between the two Dominions and the new Provinces which came into existence under that Act. The liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal were distributed by Articles 8 (2), 9 (b) and 10 (2) of the Order. Article 8 in express terms deals with contractual liability; Article 9 read with Article 8 (6) leads to the conclusion that ""liabilities in respect of loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" of the Province of Bengal which were outstanding before the appointed day, are also a special class of contractual liabilities; and then Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an ""actionable wrong other than a breach of contract"". It is not disputed that the classification of liabilities made by Articles 8, 9 and 10 is exhaustive, so that whatever is not dealt with by Articles 8 & 9 comes under Article 10. In the case of  notice was served upon the Manager of the Tripura State under the Bengal Agri. Income-tax Act calling upon him to submit a return of agricultural income received by him during the previous year. The Ruler of the State then instituted a suit in June, 1946 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca for a declaration that the aforesaid Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income-tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void and for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the assessment. The suit was transferred from the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca to the Court of a Subordinate Judge, 24-Parganas. After partition of Bengal the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the place of Province of Bengal and it raised a plea that the Court of Alipur being situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The trial Court overruled the plea, but in revision this Court reversed the decision of the trial Court upon the view that Article 10 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947 applied to tortious acts (See the decision of this Court in Province of East Bengal v. State of Tripura, 53 Cal WN 368 at p. 380) (K). On appeal the Supreme Court held that the interpretation of the expression ""actionable wrong"" as given by this Court was too narrow. The judgment of the Supreme Court is .  Patanjali Sastri J. in delivering the majority judgment observed as follows;



65. The object of the learned Additional Government Pleader in seeking to establish that the liability of the Government in the present case is founded on contract, quasi-con tract or constructive contract is to take the case out of the operation of Article 10 and bring it under Article 9 (b). In order to attract the operation of Article 9 two things must be established: (1) that the liability is a contractual liability and (2) that the financial obligations of the nature of ""such loans and guarantees as are outstanding immediately before the appointed day"". If any of these elements be found wanting the case will fall outside Article 9. I have already held that the liability in the present case cannot be said to be a contractual liability in any sense.   Therefore the first element has hot been established.   But I am of the opinion that the second element is also absent.   The words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must, by the operation of Article 8  (6), be held to mean contractual obligation and if the provisions of Article 9 (b) are to be interpreted consistently with those of Article 8  (2)   (a)  that financial  obligation must be of a class other than what is contemplated by Article 8 (2) (a).   For this reason   it has been held in the cases of Nilima Sarkar v. Governor-General in Council, 86 Cal LJ 98 (P) (Harries C. J. and S. B. Sinha J.);  (Harries C. J. and Sarkar J.);   (Sen and Chunder JJ.) that the words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words ""loans and guarantees"" in the said article.   The decisions of this Court in the cases of Midnapur Zemindary Co. Ltd. (C) and Sree Sree Madan Gopal Jiu (D), have since been approved by the Supreme Court in the case of . In that case the question was whether the liability to pay rent under a lease was a ""financial obligation"" within   the   meaning   of Article   9   (b).   The Supreme Court pointed out that though an obligation to pay money under a contract or  breach thereof was a financial obligation in the popular sense, if Article 9 were to be construed so as not to ""rob Article 8 of practically the whole of its content"", that phrase as occurring in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis  with the words  ""loans  and guarantees"".   It was further held that the whole expression ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" must be interpreted in the technical sense in which it was used in Section 178, Government of India Act, 1935 and
  ""in that context financial obligation would mean obligations arising out of arrangements or agreements relating to State finance, such as distribution of revenue, the obligation to grant financial assistance by the Union to any State or the obligation of a State to make contributions and the like.""",
Article 8,"Sree Murugan Financing Corporation ... vs The State Of Tamil Nadu Reptd. By The ... on 20 March, 1985",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1038852/?formInput=Article%208,,"(2) In Article 8, in Clause (b) for the letters and figures Rs. 50 ""occurring in two places, the letters and figures ""Rs. 250"" shall be substituted;

(3) after Article 8, as so amended, the following Article and entries shall be inserted, namely:

8A. For filing Balance-sheets audited and certified by Chartered Accountant.

(a) Where the chit amount does not exceed Rs. 500 - Rs. 10.00.

(b) When the chit amount exceeds Rs. 500 for the first Rs. 500 as under Sub-clause (a) and for every Rs. 500 or part thereof in excess of Rs. 500 subject to the maximum of Rs. 250. The fee leviable under this clause 'shall not exceed Rs. 250.



3. For the first time, for balance sheets audited by a Chartered Accountant a fee is imposed under Article 8-A. The rate of fee is the same fee which is charged when audited by chit auditors, having no nexus to the extent of service rendered by the Department. As for the increase made under Article 8, it is not challenged in these petitions. As Section 53 does not authorise imposition of fees for balance-sheets filed under Section 16 of the Act, and Section 63 alone having been invoked in carrying out the amendments, it is ultra vires of the Act. No service is rendered by the Registrar on receiving the balance-sheets and preserving them. The essential element of quid pro quo in the imposition of these fees is absent. So far as the Foremen are concerned, the Registrars do not render any special service in furtherance of his business and the fee collected has no correlation to the expenses incurred in rendering service, if any. The only ground relied upon in the impugned G.O. is that, to bring about rationalisation in rates, the fee for registration has been revised, taking into account the number of subscribers or the instalments whichever is higher, instead of the slab system which was prevailing prior to 21.10.1981. If whatever done by the Registrar at the time of registration are looked into the basis now adopted is highly irrational and unreasonable, and the imposition is disproportionate and not at all commensurate to the nature of service claimed to be rendered. Merely because in the neighbouring State of Kerala, a higher levy is imposed, the respondents have chosen to rely upon it so as to augment the general revenues of the State, and hence it is not a fee but a tax, which is not authorised under the Act.



27. As for Article 8-A in Appendix II relating to filing of balance-sheets audited and certified by Chartered Accountants are concerned, it is submitted by petitioners that there is a hostile discrimination and it acts as an unreasonable restriction on their trade and it is violative of Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 301 of the Constitution. Section 16(1) prescribes that every Foreman shall prepare and file with the Registrar a balance sheet duly audited either by auditors duly qualified to act as auditors of companies under the Companies Act, 1956 or by a chit auditor appointed under Section 51(2) of the Act and that it shall contain a summary of the assets and liabilities of the chit and furnish such other particulars as will disclose the nature of the assets and liabilities and how the value of the assets has been arrived at. Rule 26 states that a balance-sheet shall be prepared by the Foreman when the duration of the chit does not exceed one year on the termination of the chit and if it exceeds one year, then on the expiry of every period of 12 months and also on the termination of the chits, it should be filed within two months from the date of the said period. Form No. X catalogues the particulars to be furnished relating to (1) Receipts and Expenditure, (2) Statement of Assets and Liabilities, (3) Details of investments, (4) Assessment of value of investment, and (5) Profit and loss account. The Foreman has to, certify regarding the correctness and also the auditor has to certify stating that the balance-sheet is drawn up in conformity with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. An option is given to a Foreman either to file the balance-sheet audited by a Chartered Accountant or by a Chit Auditor. Under Section 51(2), a Chit Auditor is appointed by the Director of Chits. It is stated by the learned Additional Government Pleader that the Chit Auditors belong to the Department who are not qualified Chartered Accountants, but they are trained to scrutinise chit accounts. The fee charged when a Chit Auditor is approached is the same as charged when a balance-sheet certified by a Chartered Accountant is filed. It is strenuously pleaded by petitioners that when distinctly different services are contemplated as between them, the imposition of the same rate of levy of fees is hostile discrimination and an unreasonable restriction on 'the petitioners' trade. As to what requires to be done by a Chit Auditor call for consideration vis-a-vis what is done when a balance-sheet certified by Chartered Accountant --- is filed before the Registrar. Rule 28 deals with what requires to be done-when a Chit Auditor is approached for certifying balance-sheet and profit and loss account. If a Foreman desires to have the balance-sheet and profit and loss account audited by. a Chit Auditor, after the preparation of the balance-sheet, he must make an application under Rule 28 (1) to the Registrar for such audit to be done specifying whether it shall be at the premises of the Foreman or not and the application is to be accompanied by fees prescribed under Articles 8 of Appendix II. Thereafter, the Registrar will forward the application to the Inspecting Officer, who shall cause the balance-sheet and profit and loss account to be audited by the Chit Auditor, and in turn, he would send it to the Chit Auditor who shall thereupon require the Foreman to produce the chit records on such date, time and place as he may fix and it would then be the duty of the Foreman to produce ""all registers, books of accounts and other records relating to the chit accordingly and furnish such information and give such facilities as may be necessary or required for the proper audit of the balance-sheet and profit and loss account at the time and place fixed by the Chit Auditor"". A notice of not less than seven days shall be given to the Foreman as to the date of audit at the premi(sic) of the Foreman or for the production of registers, books of accounts and other records relating to the chit as the case may be. After scrutiny of all these documents, under Rule 29, the Chit Auditor will prepare his report and issue the certificate in quadruple and send one copy to the Foreman, the second to the Registrar and the third to the Inspecting Officer and keep the last copy for his own file. Rule 30(1) enjoins upon the Foreman to file with the Registrar a copy of the balance-sheet and profit and loss account together with the audit certificate and the auditor's report within one month from the date of the receipt from the Chit Auditor or within four months from the last date of the period covered by the balance-sheet whichever is earlier whereas, when a certificate is secured from a Chartered Accountant, Rule 30(2) directs the Foreman ""to file"" with the Registrar the documents which are referred to in Sub-rule (1) of Rule 30 within three months of the expiry of the period with reference to which, the balance-sheet is prepared under Rule 27.



This claim made is not in accord with what is found in Rule 30(2). Under the Rules only when a Chit Auditor prepares, a balance-sheet, registers, books of accounts and other records and other information have to be furnished under Rule 30(2), they are not required to be submitted. When a Chartered Accountant's certificate is filed, it cannot be said that in all those cases where such certificates are filed, once over the same work done by a Chit Auditor is carried out justifying the same rate of fee being charged. It may be that whenever any irregularities are found, it may call for a fresh clarification from the Foreman, but that would not mean that for all the chits without exception, the Registrar discharges, the same kind of services as done when a Chit Auditor is requisitioned. It must be pointed out that, when fee is collected under Article 8, it includes the services rendered by the Chit Auditor and also the services of scrutiny by the Registrar, who acts upon such certificate; whereas for the same fee paid when a Chit Auditor's certificate is filed, it results only in scrutiny by the Registrar and nothing more. Hence, to treat unlike situations as one and the same and impose same rate of fee, is arbitrary and illegal. When rules themselves do not comtemplate production of registers, books of accounts and other records, the claim made that pursuant to the filing of the balance-sheet, records have to be verified and that the whole matter has got to be thoroughly examined, is. unacceptable. In such of those matters where irregularities are noticed, the Registrar can call for all the records and scrutinise them and thereafter initiate prosecution or take such other action. Such instances would arise in both categories. Hence,
 when the rules themselves contemplate a different type of services to be rendered when Chartered, Accountant's certificates are filed, the fee imposable under Article 8-A cannot be the same as in Articles 8 which contemplates more comprehensive services to be rendered. Therefore, as rightly pleaded by the petitioners, the necessary element of quid pro quo is not existing., and furthermore this is an unreasonable restriction on right of trade and the rate fixed is aimed at increasing general revenues. It is of pointed interest to note that right from inception of the Act, such a fee was never contemplated, and that the Director of Chits drew inspiration from what is obtaining in Kerala and his proposals have been just accepted by the Government without any analysis made of what rates could be fixed on conditions prevailing governing the Act in force in Kerala and what nature of services are rendered by those authorities, are not spelt out. These conclusions 'arrived at are not to be understood that the State is disentitled from imposing any fee for filing of such balance-sheets under Article 8-A. A rate which would be commensurate to the nature of services extended by departmental personnel could be fixed, but what is now charged being identical to the fee imposed under Article 8, it is an illegal imposition.",
Article 8,"Commissioner Of Income-Tax, Bombay ... vs J.B. Advani Oerlikon Electrodes Pvt. ... on 11 November, 1976",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1612590/?formInput=Article%208,,"3. Under article 8 of the said agreement the licensee, in consideration of the rights transferred to it under the agreement and of the obligations assumed by the Swiss company, agreed to pay to the Swiss company a running royalty of 2% and a contribution of 3%. The agreement was to ensure for a minimum period of fifteen years.  

 4. It may be mentioned that in this reference we are concerned only with the 3% contribution provided in article 8 and not with the 2% running royalty inasmuch as the later payment has been allowed and there is no dispute about it.  



 5. Subsequently, the benefit of this agreement was taken over by the assessee-company which had assumed all the rights and obligation of J. B. Advani & Co. under the agreement with the Swiss Company.  

 6. For the two years in question the assessee-company paid to the Swiss company the amounts of Rs. 2,20,663 and Rs. 3,19,234 being the contribution at 3% under article 8. The claim of the assessee for deduction of the two amounts mentioned above for the two years was accepted by the Income-tax Officer. Subsequently, however, the Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay City I, considered that the action of the Income-tax Officer in allowing 3% research contribution as a deduction was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and took action under section 33B of the Indian Income-tax Act, 1922. After giving the necessary opportunity to the assessee, the Commissioner passed order under that section modifying the assessment in question so as to disallow the amounts claimed as deduction. The assessee, thereafter, carried the matter to the Income-tax Appellate Tribunal contending that the amounts claimed as deduction should be allowed under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv) of the said Act or, in any event, under the residuary section 10(2)(xv) of the said Act. Reliance was placed on the specific terms of the agreement as well as on the correspondence between the assessee and the Swiss company. The Tribunal held that the assessee had not made out a case for allowance under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv) of the Act, but that the assessee would be eligible for allowance of the expenditure under section 10(2)(xv) of the Act. The Tribunal accordingly directed that the amounts disallowed under the orders or the Commissioner under section 33B should be allowed as deduction in the assessments in question.  



 8. In his order, the Commissioner considered the two amounts paid to the Swiss company in the two years in question as amounts paid for research contribution and concluded that they were not admissible as deduction. In his order, the Commissioner construed article 8 as providing that 2% is earmarked as running royalty for the rights conferred on the assessee and 3% is earmarked as a research fee or contribution. He read article 8 with article 6 and observed that research is directed towards improving the method of production of the electrodes and evolving improved formulae of recipes therefor. According to the Commissioner, the research expenses were incurred for the improvement of capital asset and, therefore, assumed the character of capital expenditure.  



 10. It is necessary to refer in detail to the correspondence which is made part of the statement of the case as annexure ""D"" (collectively). But a perusal thereof would seem to bear out the point urged by the assessee before the Tribunal. In fact, if the later part of article 8(a) is carefully scrutinised, it is clear that the research work which may be sought for by the licensee was ""in order to enable the licensee to the smooth running of his production and to meet the demands of the market"". It is obvious, therefore, that this was not a contribution for the general research work carried on by the Swiss company at its laboratories in Switzerland but in the nature of payment contemplated to be made in order to obtain assistance from the Swiss company for the solution or various problems and difficulties as would arise in the day-to-day working of the assessee-company and such solutions as were necessary for the smooth running of the assessee-company's factory and for meeting the demands of the market. The correspondence would also indicate that this is how the provisions in article 8(a) above set out were understood by the parties and acted upon. The Tribunal upheld the view of the Commissioner that the two amounts were not deductible under section 10(2)(xii) or section 10(2)(xiv). According to the Tribunal, it was not possible to accept that 3% contribution was payable exclusively for general research, but it was a sort of composite payment as indicated in para. 8 of the order of the Tribunal. According to the Tribunal, this nature of the contribution rendered it ineligible for being considered as an allowable deduction under section 10(2)(xii) of the Act.",

     conspiracy to  deceive the House of

The observations if Cockburn CJ., with whom Blackburn J. has
concurred, show	 that the  substance of the information laid
by Wason  was that  the alleged conspiracy was to make false
statements and	that such  statements were made in the House
of Lords  and that  the said  statements had  been made	 the
foundation  of	 the  criminal	proceeding.  Though  in	 the
judgment there	is no  reference to Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights but  the tenor of the abovequoted observations of the
learned Judges leave no doubt that the judgment was based on
that Article.  It has been so understood in later judgments.
[See : R.V. Caurrie & Ors.].



		       in
     We may  now examine whether the decision Ex parte Wason
has any	 bearing on  the interpretation	 of Article  105(2).
Clauses (1)  and (2)  of Article  105 are interlinked, while
clause (1)  secures to	the Members  freedom  of  speech  in
Parliament, clause  (@) safeguards  and	 protects  the	said
freedom by conferring immunity on the Members from liability
in respect  of anything	 said or  any vote  given by  him in
Parliament or  in any  committee thereof.  This is necessary
because for  a regulatory  body like Parliament, the freedom
of speech  is of  the utmost  importance and a full and free
debate is  on the  essence of  Parliamentary  democracy.  In
England this  freedom of  speech in Parliament is secured by
Article 9  of the  Bill of Rights. Though clause (2) Article
105 appears to be similar to Article 9 of the Bill of Rights
but a  closer look  would show	that they   certain aspects.
Article 9  of  the  Bill  of  Rights,  by  prescribing	that
""freedom of  speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament
ought not  to be  impeached or	questioned in  any court  or
place out  of Parliament"",  confers immunity  in respect  of
speech,	 debates   or  proceedings   in	  Parliament   being
questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. The said
immunity has  been construed  to precluded  what was said or
done in	 Parliament in the course of proceedings there being
examined outside  Parliament for the purpose of supporting a
cause of  action even though the case of action itself arose
out of	something done	outside Parliament.  See : Church of
Scientology of	California v. Johnson Smith, 1972 (1) All ER
378]. In an Australian case R. v. Murphy, (1986) 5 NSWLR 18,
a question  arose whether  in the  course of criminal trial,
the witness's earlier evidence to the Select Committee could
be put	to him in cross-examination with a view to showing a
previous inconsistent  statement. Hunt	J.  in	the  Supreme
Court of New South Wales, held that Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights did  not prohibit  such cross-examination even if the
suggestion was	made that  the evidence	 given to the Select
Committee was  a lie. He further held that the statements of
the Select  Committee could  b e used to draw inferences and
could  be analysed and be made the basis of submission.



     [p. 415]
The protection	given under  clause (2)	 of Article  105  is
narrower than  that conferred under Article 9 of the Bill of
Rights in  the sense  that the	immunity conferred  by	that
clause in  personal in nature and is available to the member
in respect  of anything	 said or in any vote given by him in
the House or any committee thereof. The said clause does not
confer an  immunity for challenge in the court on the speech
or vote	 given by  a Member  of Parliament.  The  protection
given under  clause (2)	 of Article  105 is  thus similar to
protection envisaged  under the	 construction placed by Hunt
J. in  R v.,  Murphy [supra]  on Article 9 of	the Bill  of
Rights which  has not  been accepted by the Privy Council in
Prebble v.  Television New  Zealand Ltd.  The decision in Ex
parte Wason  (supra), which  was given	in  the	 context  of
Article 9  of the  Bill of  Rights, can,  therefore, have no
application in	the matter  of construction of clause (2) of
Article 105.  Ex parte	Wason (supra),	which holds that the
information laid  by Wason  did not  disclose any indictable
offence, proceeds  on the  basis  that	statements  made  by
members of either House of Parliament in their places in the
House, though they might be untrue to their knowledge, could
not be made the foundation of civil or criminal proceedings.
The position  under clause  (2) of  Article 105 is, however,
different. The	said clause does not prescribe that a speech
made or	 vote given by a member in Parliament cannot be made
the basis  of civil or criminal proceedings at all. The said
clause only  gives protection to the member who has made the
speech	or   has  given	 the  vote  from  liability  in	 any
proceeding in  a court	of law. Therefore, on the basis on t
he decision  in Ex  parte Wason	 (supra), it  cannot be said
that no	 offence was  committed by  those who are alleged to
have offered  the illegal gratification and by those who had
received  such	 gratification	to   vote  against   the  No
Confidence  Motion   and  for  that  reason  the  charge  of
conspiracy and	abetment must  also fall.  On the  basis  of
Article 105(2)	the claim  for immunity from prosecution can
be made	 only on  behalf of  A-3 to A-5 and A-16 to A-21 who
are alleged  to have voted against the No Confidence Motion.
As to  whether they  are entitled  to  such  immunity  under
Article 105(2)	will, however,	depend on the interpretation
of the provisions of Article 105(2).",
Article 9,"A.P. Moller, Maersk Agency India Pvt. ... vs Dcit, Special Range 31 on 27 January, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1674452/?formInput=Article%209,,"3. Apropos the ancillary charges, assessee did not dispute the addition before the CIT(A). For the first time issue was raised before us. It was stated to be a legal issue. After hearing learned departmental representative, we permit the assessee to raise this issue before the Tribunal.

4. We have heard the rival submissions in the light of material placed before us and precedents relied upon. Shri F.V. Irani, learned counsel for the assessee, appeared before us. Our attention was invited on Article 9 of the Convention Between Republic of India and the Kingdom of Denmark for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion With Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital. Article 9 reads as under:



""ARTICLE 9: Shipping - 1. Profits derived from the operation of ships in international traffic shall be taxable only in the Contracting State in which the place of effective management of the enterprise is situated.

2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, such profits may be taxed in the other Contracting State from which they are derived provided that the tax so charged shall not exceed:

(a) during the first five fiscal years after the entry into force of this Convention, 50 per cent, and
 




(b) profits from the operation of ships includes profits derived from the use, maintenance or rental of containers (including trailers and related equipment for the transport of containers) in connection with the transport of goods or merchandise in international traffic.""   

Learned counsel for the assessee contended that the slot fee and ancillary charges cannot be construed to be income derived from the operation of ships. As such, these cannot be taxed under Article 9(2). It was stated that the several heads of income mentioned in the I.T. Act are mutually exclusive. A particular income can come only under one of them. If the income can be brought under one head, it cannot be brought under residuary head if the heads of income are mutually exclusive. The heads of income must be decided on the nature of income by applying the practical common notions and not by reference to the assessee's treatment of income. As such, if the income is not coming within the ambit of Article 9, it cannot be taxed. For this proposition, reliance was placed on the decision rendered in the case of CIT v. T.P. Sidhwa(133 ITR 840) and Nalinikant Ambalal Modi v. CIT (61 ITR 428)(SC).



10. Section 90, Sub-section(2) of the Act reads as under:
 ""(2) Where the Central Government has entered into an agreement with the Government of any country outside India under Sub-section (1) for granting relief of tax, or as the case may be, avoidance of double taxation, then, in relation to the assessee to whom such agreement applies, the provisions of this Act shall apply to the extent they are more beneficial to that assessee."" 

11. The prescription of Section 90(2) can be invoked only if DTAA applies to the income in dispute. Article 9 says about profit derived from the operation of ships. Learned counsel for the assessee admitted that slot charges and ancillary charges are not corning within the ambit of the income from operation of ships. We find that the term 'derived' is used in Article 9. The dictionaries state that the word 'derived' is usually followed by the word 'from', and it means: get or trace from a source; arise from, originate in, so the origin or formation of. As a matter of plain English, when it is said that one word is derived from another, often in another language, what is meant is that the source of that word is another word, often in another language. As an illustration, the word 'democracy' is derived from the Greek word 'demos', the people, and most dictionaries will so state. That is the ordinary meaning of the words ""derived from"" and there is no reason to depart from that ordinary meaning here. As such, slot charges and ancillary charges cannot be construed to be income derived from the operation of ships. Article 9 is the only Article in the DTAA dealing with the shipping business. It restricted the applicability of Article only to that income which is derived from the operation of ship. The other incomes of shipping companies are not coming within the ambit of Article 9. Article 7 cannot be applied in the facts of the present case as it is not connected with the shipping business, for which a separate Article is there. Even income derived from operation of ships is to be charged to tax in India in accordance with the provision of Article 9(2) of the DTAA. To construe the meaning of the words ""such profits"" as used in Article 9(2), learned counsel argued that such profits means profits from operation of ships. Slot charges and ancillary charges are not the profits from the operation of ships. As such, these cannot be taxed under Article 9(2). In the same breath, he says that as there is no provision in the DTAA for taxing such profits, therefore, no tax should be charged on such profits. For that, he relied on T.P. Sidhwa's case and Nalinimkant Modi's case. These decisions are not pertinent to the issue. If a special provision is made on a certain matter, the matter is excluded from the general provision. This idea is inculcated in the dictum: GENERALIBUS SPECIALLA DEROGANT (special things derogate from general things). When DTAA deals with shipping business under Article 9, no other Article can be invoked in the context of shipping business. It is therefore clear that DTAA is silent over taxing the profits of shipping company derived otherwise than from the operation of ships. In such eventuality, the profits can be taxed in India as per the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961.",
Article 9,"M/S. Honda Cars India Ltd., Uttar ... vs Dcit (Ltu), New Delhi on 18 August, 2017",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/21058559/?formInput=Article%209,,"9.   On the other hand, Ld. CIT(DR) argued that on the facts and
circumstances of the case, the disallowance under section 40(a)(i) of the
Act is correct in law. His arguments are summarized as under:
     (a) that provisions of article 9(1) of DTAA apply to the facts of this
        case, which is one of the exceptions mentioned in article 24(3)
        of the DTAA, thus, the assessee cannot invoke article 24(3) of
        the DTAA between Indian & Japan.
     (b) that in the case of Herbalife International India private limited
        (supra) the Hon'ble High Court at para-34 has recorded that it is
        not the case of the Revenue that article 9(1) or article 11(7)
        applies in that case and hence the case is distinguishable


                                                     & 5483/Del/2014







(c) that regarding the contention of the assessee the TPO has
  found all the transaction to be at arm's length and hence the
  conditions laid down in article 9(1) are not satisfied, the Ld. DR
  submitted that the TPO's order was constrained by the
  disclosure made before him by the assessee and TPO's order
  did not capture more than 40 elements, which constituted 'the
  condition in terms of Article 9(1) 'from the FAR analysis
  presented before him. The AO vividly captured these 40
  elements which is brought on record due to 2 surveys carried
  out by the AO and ITO (TDS), respectively. Otherwise, the
  applicability of article 9 would depend on whether any
  adjustment to ALP is made, even though the transaction are
  made every year with the same AEs, which would not be a
  rational interpretation.



 (h) that the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Herbalife
        (supra) relied upon by the assessee does not deal with the
        provision of section 40(a)(i) as amended by Finance Act (No.2)
        2004, w.e.f., 01/04/2005.

10.   In rejoinder, the Ld. counsel of the assessee submitted that all the
contention raised by the Ld. CIT(DR) had already been considered by
the coordinate bench in the assessee's own case for assessment year
2009-10. The learned counsel also submitted that the arguments taken
up by the Revenue on the applicability of article 9 of the DTAA and
hence the exclusion of article 24(3) has no merits since the TPO are
consistently found that the transaction between the assessee and all the
non-resident companies were at arm's length. He submitted that a plain
reading of article 9 of the DTAA reveals that what is required under the
said article is that the transaction between the associated enterprises
should be conducted on arm's length basis and uninfluenced by the
close relationship. He submitted that said test has been met in the
present case when the TPO has found all the transaction between the
assessee and its AEs on arm's length basis. Thus, he submitted that the
effort of the Revenue to distinguish the jurisdictional High Court in the
case of Herbalife (supra), was without any merit.



   These findings are binding on us. Thus, we have to uphold the
   arguments of the ld. counsel for the assessee and reverse the
   findings of the AO as confirmed by the ld.CIT(A).

18. Coming to the argument of the ld. DR that the conditions stated
in Article 24(3) are not satisfied, as provisions of Article 9(1) applies,
as the transactions are between AEs and the profits which would,
but for those conditions would have accrued to one of the
enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued,
we find that the Transfer Pricing Officer in all these cases has come
to the conclusion that the transactions between the Associated
Enterprises are at arm's length price. The ld. DR made strenuous
and elaborate submissions bringing out certain issues raised by the
AO, to persuade us that TPO was wrong in coming to the conclusion
that the transactions between the AEs and the assessee are at
arm's length. We find that the TPO has passed the order after the
surveys were conducted on the assessee. If the AO had certain
additional material facts, he could have brought it to the notice of the
TPO and asked for a fresh report. In our view, this argument of the
Ld. D.R. is erroneous, as the revenue wants to take a stand that the
transactions between the assessee and its AE are not at arm's
length for the limited purpose of denying the benefit of the non-
discrimination article in the DTAA to the assessee and not for
making any additions under the transfer pricing provisions. Year
after year, the transfer pricing officer has given a finding that the
transactions between the assessee and the AE are at arm's length.
The ld. DR, without specifically pointing out as to what is the
difference between the arm's length price and the price at which the
transactions have taken place between the assessee and the AE
and without quantifying the excess/shortage in the price, seeks to
invoke Article 9(1). In our view, such an argument is devoid of merit
and hence we dismiss the same.",
Article 9,"T.A. Mahomed Usman vs State Of Madras Represented By Secy. To ... on 17 November, 1959",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1506246/?formInput=Article%209,,"The other articles which are of immediate relevance to the cases before us are Articles 9, 10 and 11.

 ""Article 9: No person shall be a citizen of India
by virtue of article 5, or be deemed to be a citizen
of India by virtue of article 6 or article 8, if he has
voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign
State.   

 Article 10: Every person who is or is deemed to be a citizen of India under any of the foregoing provisions of this Part shall, subject to the provisions of any law that may be made by Parliament, continue to be such citizen.  



  By virtue of Article 9 a person would not be deemed to be citizen of India by birth or by reason of relationship, if he had voluntarily acquired the citizenship of any foreign state. But obviously Article 9 has application to the acquisition of citizenship of a foreign State before the commencement of the Constitution, and is in the nature of a proviso or rider to the other articles, under which a person is treated as a citizen of India. The expression ""foreign State"" is defined in Article 367 as meaning any State other than India. This is however subject to the proviso 'provided that subject to the provisions of any law made by Parliament, the President may by order declare any State not to be a foreign state for such purposes as may be specified in the order'. 



 19. It would thus be seen that though Pakistan might not have been a foreign country within the meaning of Article 9 of the Constitution because oft the Governor-General's order promulgated under Article 367(3), the acquisition of Pakistani citizenship would terminate the Indian citizenship of a person under the Citizenship Act, 1955, and this position was not contested.  

 20. The arguments of learned counsel ranged over a very wide field, but before entering into a discussion on the points urged, it might be convenient to set out two matters--merely to put them aside. The first relates to a contention, that the rules contained in Schedule III of the Citizenship Rules, 1956 infringed 'the freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India' and 'to move freely throughout the territory of India' guaranteed by Articles 19(1)(d) and 19(1)(e) of the Constitution.  



 At the same time, recognising that several persons who would be Indian citizens under Article 5 had migrated to Pakistan, at the time of the Partition, it makes provision in Article 7 for such persons not being Indian citizens, and finally Article 9 recognises the right of Indian citizens to voluntarily ex-patriate themselves. It is clear that the principle of jus soli and jus sanguinis enunciated by Article 5, must give rise to the problem of dual nationality, and by Article 11 Parliament is expressly vested with power to make laws providing inter alia for terminat-ing Indian Citizenship.",
Article 9,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%209,,"27. I am also inclined to agree with sen and Chunder JJ. Vide  that Article 9 has obviously some reference to Section 178, Government of India Act where the same words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" occur, which reasonably suggests that Article 9, like the said Section 178, deals only with liabilities, connected with matters of revenue.

28. Indeed, it seems to me that the framers of Article 9 of the 1947 Order borrowed not only the phrase ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" from the corresponding Section 178, Government of India Act of 1935 which was then in force but also the broad scheme of that statute in the matter of the nature, scope and classification of contractual rights and liabilities of the State and a comparison of Ss. 177 and 178 of the Act of 1935 with Arts. 8 and 9 of the 1947 Order will show that, under both, State or Government contractual liabilities were grouped under two heads, namely, special contracts like loans, guarantees etc   and contracts in general.    The latter were dealt with in Section 177 and Article 8 and the former in the succeeding Section 178 and Article 9.   The opening words of Section 177(1), namely, ""without prejudice  to the  special provisions of the next succeeding section (Section 178) relating to loans, guarantees and other financial obligations,"" -- and  these words ""loans,   guarantees and other financial obligations"" which, in this Section 177, plainly refer to  certain special or excepted types of contractual liabilities obviously bear also the same sense in the succeeding Section 178, -- ""any contract etc."" and the opening words of Cl (6) of Article 8, namely, ""the provisions of this Article (Article 8)  shall have effect subject to the provisions of Article 9 of the Order"", read in the light of the reference to ""any contract"" and ""all..... liabilities which have accrued or may accrue under 'the contract' or any such contract' "" in the earlier parts of the Article (Article 8), are sufficient to show that by the words ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" were meant only contractual liabilities of some special type as distinguished from contractual liabilities in general, I do not think it is possible to contend, in view of the clear language of the two provisions (Section 177 and Article 8), that they purport to deal with any liability except contractual liability and, if that be so, the reservations, made in the quotations, set out above, must obviously refer to liabilities, arising out of certain transactions which are treated as special contracts at least for purposes of the above Act and Order.



 ""The obligation to pay rent is in one sense a financial obligation, but I think it is clear that the words 'and   other financial   obligations   of a province' in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words 'loans and guarantees.....

Clearly it was not intended to cover purely contractual obligations; otherwise, Article 8 becomes wholly Worthless."" 

In , their Lordships were concerned with the claim for compensation for land acquired in the district of Burd-wan before the appointed day; a suit had been filed also before the appointed day and their Lordships held that the suit for compensation for land acquired must be regarded as a suit for the land which under Article 5 had devolved on the province of West Bengal and under Article 12, the province of West Bengal must be substituted for the Province of Bengal. In repelling the argument advanced on behalf of the West Bengal Government that the claim could be covered by Article 9. Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, their Lordships (Sen and Chunder JJ.) repeated the observations of Harries C. J., in the earlier case, viz., that the words 'other financial obligations' must be interpreted as ejusdem generis with loans and guarantees. Their Lordships grave the reason that Article 9 has reference to Article 178, Government of India Act, 1935, where the same words 'loans and guarantees and other financial obligations' are also used, and that it would appear from the Government of India Act that the obligations considered in that connection were obligations charged upon the revenue of the State and therefore in Article 9 of the Bights, Property and Liabilities order also the words 'other financial obligations' must mean obligations of the same nature as loans and guarantees charged on the revenue of the State, It may however be pointed out that in Section 178, Government of India Act, the words 'other financial obligations'  are   expressly defined   as  obligations secured on the revenues.   Clause (1)  of Section 178 deals with ""all liabilities in respect of such loans guarantees and other obligations of the Secretary of State in Council as are outstanding immediately before the commencement of Part III of this Act, and were secured on the revenues of India"". Clause (4) of the same section deals with ""any loans or other financial obligations secured upon the revenues of province"" in respect of liability of any local Government in India.   In Article 9 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, the words 'other financial obligations' are not expressly qualified as to mean obligations which are charged on the revenues of the State, and even accepting   that   the   expression   ""other   financial obligations"" is to be interpreted ejusdem generis with  loans and guarantees, the  point has to be borne in mind in deciding what can be included within that expression.



48. In a case decided and reported after we had heard the arguments in the present cape, the Supreme Court considered the meaning of the expression 'other financial obligations' as used in Article 9; vide . In that case, the liability to pay rent under a lease was the liability under consideration; it was held that it did not come within Article 9 but would come within Article 8. The Supreme Court observed that if the expression other financial obligations' were interpreted ejus-dem generis with the expressions loans' and 'guarantees' there could be no difficulty in drawing the line between matters that would fall within Article 8 and those that would fall within Article 9. The Supreme Court referred in this connection to the two Calcutta cases already referred to. But the Supreme Court did not finally decide what obligations would be included in the expression 'other financial obligations;' and observed that in each case the question whether a particular obligation fell within the, expression 'financial obligations' within the meaning of Article 9 would have to be considered.



65. The object of the learned Additional Government Pleader in seeking to establish that the liability of the Government in the present case is founded on contract, quasi-con tract or constructive contract is to take the case out of the operation of Article 10 and bring it under Article 9 (b). In order to attract the operation of Article 9 two things must be established: (1) that the liability is a contractual liability and (2) that the financial obligations of the nature of ""such loans and guarantees as are outstanding immediately before the appointed day"". If any of these elements be found wanting the case will fall outside Article 9. I have already held that the liability in the present case cannot be said to be a contractual liability in any sense.   Therefore the first element has hot been established.   But I am of the opinion that the second element is also absent.   The words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must, by the operation of Article 8  (6), be held to mean contractual obligation and if the provisions of Article 9 (b) are to be interpreted consistently with those of Article 8  (2)   (a)  that financial  obligation must be of a class other than what is contemplated by Article 8 (2) (a).   For this reason   it has been held in the cases of Nilima Sarkar v. Governor-General in Council, 86 Cal LJ 98 (P) (Harries C. J. and S. B. Sinha J.);  (Harries C. J. and Sarkar J.);   (Sen and Chunder JJ.) that the words ""financial obligation"" in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis with the words ""loans and guarantees"" in the said article.   The decisions of this Court in the cases of Midnapur Zemindary Co. Ltd. (C) and Sree Sree Madan Gopal Jiu (D), have since been approved by the Supreme Court in the case of . In that case the question was whether the liability to pay rent under a lease was a ""financial obligation"" within   the   meaning   of Article 9   (b).   The Supreme Court pointed out that though an obligation to pay money under a contract or  breach thereof was a financial obligation in the popular sense, if Article 9 were to be construed so as not to ""rob Article 8 of practically the whole of its content"", that phrase as occurring in Article 9 must be construed ejusdem generis  with the words  ""loans  and guarantees"".   It was further held that the whole expression ""loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" must be interpreted in the technical sense in which it was used in Section 178, Government of India Act, 1935 and
  ""in that context financial obligation would mean obligations arising out of arrangements or agreements relating to State finance, such as distribution of revenue, the obligation to grant financial assistance by the Union to any State or the obligation of a State to make contributions and the like.""",
Article 9,"Mitsubishi Corporation India Pvt. ... vs Dcit, Circle- 16(2), New Delhi on 22 September, 2017",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/122427784/?formInput=Article%209,,"3. Except where the provisions of article 9, paragraph 8 of article
11, or paragraph 7 of article 12 apply, interest, royalties and other
disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a
resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of
determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible
under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of
the first mentioned Contracting State.........'.

17     It is equally important to consider the prescription of
Article 9, the relevant part of which runs as under :-



                               16                   ITA No5184/Del/2017




18.     The case of the ld. AR is that the assessee is entitled to the
benefit of Article 24 in terms of para 3. A perusal of this para
transpires that except where the provisions of Article 9 etc. apply,
interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an Indian
enterprise to a Japanese enterprise, shall, be deductible in
determining the taxable profits of the Indian enterprise under the
same conditions as if they had been paid to an Indian resident.
Simply stated, para 3 of Article 24 provides that any payment
made by an Indian enterprise to a Japanese enterprise shall, for
the purposes of determining the taxable profit of an Indian
enterprise, be taken up under the same conditions as if the
payment had been made to an Indian resident and not to a non-
resident. In simple words, for the purpose of computing the
taxable profit of an Indian enterprise, the provisions of the Act
shall apply on a transaction with a Japanese enterprise as if it is a
transaction with an Indian enterprise. If the transaction with a
Japanese enterprise entails some adverse consequences in
comparison with if such transaction had been made with an
Indian enterprise, then such adverse consequences will be
remedied under this clause by presuming, for computing the total
income of an Indian enterprise, as if it was a transaction with an
Indian enterprise and not a Japanese enterprise. Thus, Article 24
provides in unequivocal terms that for the purposes of
determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, any
disbursements made to a Japanese enterprise shall be deductible
in the same manner as if it had been made to an Indian resident.
When we examine the TDS provisions, it is noticed that no
provision under the Chapter XVII of the Act stipulates for
deduction of tax at source from payment made for the purchases
made from an Indian resident. This position when contrasted
with purchases made from a non-resident, imposes liability on the
purchaser for deducting tax at source under section 195, subject
to the fulfilment of other conditions. When we compare an Indian
enterprise purchasing goods from an Indian party vis-a-vis from a
Japanese party, there is possibility of an obvious discrimination
in terms of disallowance of purchase consideration under section
40(a)(i) in so far as the purchases from a Japanese enterprise are
concerned. It is this discrimination which is sought to be
remedied by para 3 of Article 24. The effect of this Article is that
in determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, the
provisions of the Act, including disallowance u/s 40(a)(i), shall
apply as if the purchases made from a Japanese enterprise are
made from an Indian enterprise. Once purchases are construed to
have been made by an Indian enterprise from another Indian
enterprise, not requiring any deduction of tax at source from the
                              17                   ITA No5184/Del/2017


purchase consideration and consequently ousting the application
of section 40(a)(i), the non-discrimination clause shall operate to
stop the making of disallowance in case of purchases actually
made from a Japanese enterprise, which would have otherwise
attracted the disallowance. Thus, it is evident that para 3 of
Article 24, without considering the effect of Article 9 and other
Articles referred to in the beginning of this para, rules out the
making of disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.



19.     Now let us examine Article 9 of the DTAA and its setting
in Article 24(3), which in the opinion of the ld. DR, comes to the
rescue of the Revenue in making inoperative the otherwise
applicability of para 3 of Article 24. The opening part of para 3
provides that `Except where the provisions of article 9 .... apply'.
Then it talks about the application of non-discrimination as
discussed above. This shows that the provisions of Article 24(3)
shall be restricted to the extent of applicability of Article 9. In
other words, whatever has been provided in Article 9 shall remain
intact and will have superseding effect over the mandate of
Article 24(3). The contention of the ld. DR that once Article 9
applies, then the application of Article 24(3) is thrown out, is not
wholly correct. The writ of Article 9 does not stop the
application of Article 24(3) in entirety. The overriding effect of
Article 9 over para 3 of Article 24 is limited to its content alone.
In other words, the mandate of Article 24 applies save and except
as provided in Article 9 etc. It does not render Article 24(3)
redundant in totality. A conjoint reading of these two Articles
brings out that if there is some discrimination in computing the
taxable income as regards the substance of Article 9, then such
discrimination will continue as such. But, in so far as rest of the
discriminations covered under para 3 of Article 24 are concerned,
those will be removed to the extent as provided.



20.     Now let us decipher the instruction of the relevant part of
Article 9 of the DTAA as extracted above. Para 1 of this Article
can be viewed in two parts, viz., clause (a) or clause (b) as one
part and the portion starting with `and' as the second part. Such
first part sets out the basic condition for the applicability of the
second part. The first part provides for the one enterprise directly
or indirectly controlling or contributing to the capital of the other
or the existence of common persons managing or contributing to
the capital of both the enterprises. The existence of the conditions
set out in the first part in the case of the assessee has not been
disputed by the ld. AR. The second part of para 1 of Article 9
provides that when the stipulations of the first part of para 1 of
Article 9 are satisfied AND the conditions between the two
                              18                  ITA No5184/Del/2017


enterprises in their commercial or financial relations differ from
those which would have been between two independent
enterprises, then, any profit which has not accrued to one of the
enterprises due to such conditions, may be included in the profits
of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. The effect of the second
part is that the transactions between the two enterprises should be
viewed at arm's length notwithstanding their commercial or
financial relations. And if the profit accruing to an enterprise has
been understated due to such commercial or financial relations,
then, such understated profits should also be taxed. On
circumspection of Article 9 read with Article 24, the position
which emerges is that the enhancement of income made by virtue
of Article 9 in treating the inhibited transactions between two
enterprises as at arm's length price, cannot be neutralised by the
application of Article 24. In other words, Article 24 applies on all
discriminations as set out in it except those specifically excluded
including Article 9. Reverting to the facts of the instant case, we
find that the assessee is seeking the benefit of article 24 qua the
disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) and not in respect of any transfer
pricing adjustment made by bringing transactions between two
AEs at arm's length price. Disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is an
independent component of the computation of total income which
is distinct from any transfer pricing adjustment. Article 24 read
with Article 9 albeit prohibits the deletion of enhancement of
income due to the making of transactions at ALP, but permits the
deletion of enhancement of income due to disallowance u/s
40(a)(i) of the Act. Be that as it may, we find that the TPO has
not proposed any transfer pricing adjustment in respect of
`Trading segment' of the assessee under which the purchases in
question were made. The addition on account of TP adjustment
is in respect of `Service fee received', which was earned by the
assessee without making purchases of the goods from its AEs.
As disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is in respect of purchases made from
the AEs, which is in no manner connected with the Commission
segment, we hold that the assessee is entitled to the benefit
provided by article 24 of the DTAA and cannot be visited with
the disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.",
Article 9,"Eco Maritime Ventures Ltd vs Ing Bank Nv on 27 June, 2016",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/54155741/?formInput=Article%209,,"12. Now let us interpret Articles 3(1) and (4) of

          O/OJCA/234/2016                                             ORDER



         the   critical   link   between   the   person   liable   and  
         the   vessel   on   both   the   occasions,   i.e.   at   the  
         time   of   accrual   of   cause   of   action   and   at   the  
         time   of   arrest.   The   question   is   whether   the  
         requirement,   therefore,   that   the   owner   must   be  
         the person liable (save when the claim is secured  
         by   a  maritime   lien)   is   implied   by   Article   3(1).  
         That it is so implied  is clear from the reading  
         of   Article   3   as   a   whole,   firstly,   because  
         otherwise   there   is   no   reason   why   a   ship   other  
         than that in respect of which the maritime claim  
         has arisen can be arrested  on the basis  that it  
         is   owned   by   the   owner   of   the   particular   ship  
         (i.e. that ship in respect of which the maritime  
         claim has arisen). Secondly, the opening words of  
         Article   3(1),   ""subject   to   the   provisions   of  
         paragraph 4"", also make it clear that paragraph 4  
         constitutes an exception to the general rule laid  
         down in paragraph 1. Since the exception consists  
         in   the   right   of   arrest   of   a   ship   when   the 
         charterer   by   demise   and   not   the   owner   is   liable  
         in   respect   of   the   maritime   claim,   in   all   other  
         cases   the   general   rule   must   apply,   namely,   that  
         the arrest is only permissible when the owner of  
         the   ship   is   liable.   This   implication   is   also  
         clear   when   we   read   Article   9   of   the   1952  
         Convention   in   conjunction   with   Article   3(1). 
         Article 9 is in the following words:

9. The proceedings of the Constituent Assembly on draft Article (10) disclose a persistent and strident demand from certain sections of the society for providing reservations in their favour in the matter of public employment. While speaking on the draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] Dr. Ambedkar had stated, ""then we have quite a massive opinion which insists that although theoretically it is good to have the principle that there shall be equality of opportunity, there must at the same time be a provision made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration."" It was this demand which was mainly responsible for the incorporation of Clause (4) in Article 16. As matter of fact, in some of the southern States, reservations in favour of O.B.Cs. were in vogue since quite a number of years prior to the Constitution. There was a demand for similar reservations at the center. In response to this demand and also in realisation of its obligation to provide for such reservations in favour of backward sections of the society, the Central Government appointed a Backward Class Commission under Article 340 of the Constitution on January 29, 1953. The Commission, popularly known as Kaka Kalelkar Commission, was required ""to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes within the territory of India and the difficulties under which they labour and to make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by the Union or any State to remove difficulties and to improve their conditions"". The Commission submitted its report on March 30, 1955. According to it, the relevant factors to consider while classifying backward classes would be their traditional occupation and profession, the percentage of literacy or the general educational advancement made by them; the estimated population of the community and the distribution of the various communities throughout the state or their concentration in certain areas. The Commission was also of the opinion that the social position which a community occupies in the caste hierarchy would also have to be considered as well as its representation in Government service or in the Industrial sphere. According to the Commission, the causes of educational backwardness amongst the educationally and backward communities were (i) traditional apathy for education on account of social and environmental conditions or occupational handicaps: (ii) poverty and lack of educational institutions in rural areas and (iii) living in inaccessible areas. The Chairman of the commission, Kaka Kalelkar, however, had second thoughts after signing the report. In the enclosing letter addressed to the President he virtually pleaded for the rejection of the report on the ground that the reservations and other remedies recommended on the basis of caste would not be in the interest of society and country. He opined that the principle of caste should be eschewed altogether. Then alone, he said, would it be possible to help the extremely poor and deserving members of all the communities. At the same time, he added, preference ought to be given to those who come from traditionally neglected social classes.



PART - II
 
 

Before we proceed to answer the questions aforementioned, it would be helpful to notice (a) the debates in the Constituent Assembly on Article 16 (draft Article 10); (b) the decisions of this Court on Articles 16 and 15; and (c) a few decisions of the U.S.Supreme Court considering the validity of race-conscious programmes.

The Framing of Article 16: Debates in the Constituent Assembly
  25. Draft Article 10 corresponds to Article 16. The debate in the Constituent Assembly on draft Article 10 and particularly Clause (3), thereof [corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16] helps us to appreciate the background and understand the objective underlying Article 16, and in particular, Clause (4) thereof. The original intent comes out clear and loud from these debates. 



Ultimately Dr. B.R.Ambedkar, the Chairman of the Drafting Committee, got up to clarify the matter. His speech, which put an end to all discussion and led to adopting of draft Article 10(3), is worth quoting in extenso, since it throws light on several questions relevant herein:

...there are three points of view which it is necessary for us to reconcile if we are to produce a workable proposition which will be accepted by all. Of the three points of view, the first is that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens. It is the desire of many Members of this House that every individual who is qualified for a particular post should be free to apply for that post, to sit for examinations and to have his qualifications tested so as to determine whether he is fit for the post or not and that there ought to be no limitations, there ought to be no hindrance in the operation of this principle of equality or opportunity. Another view mostly shared by a section of the House is that, if this principle is to be operative-and it ought to be operative in their judgment to its fullest extent-there ought to be no reservations of any sort for any class or community at all, that all citizens, if they are qualified, should be placed on the same footing of equality so far as the public services are concerned. That is the second point of view we have. Then we have quite a massive opinion which insists that, although theoretically it is good to have the principle that there shall be equality of opportunity, there must at the same time be a provision made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration. As I said, the Drafting Committee had to produce a formula which would reconcile these three points of view, firstly, that there shall be equality of opportunity, secondly that there shall be reservations in favour of certain communities which have not so far had a 'proper look-in' so to say into the administration. If honourable Members will bear these facts in mind-the-three principles we had to reconcile,-they will see that no better formula could be produced than the one that is embodies in Sub-clause (3) of Article 10 of the Constitution. It is a generic principle. At the same time, as I said, we had to reconcile this formula with the demand made by certain communities that the administration which has now-for historical reasons-been controlled by one community or a few communites, that situation should disappear and that the others also must have an opportunity of getting into the public services. Supposing, for instance, we were to concede in full the demand of those communities who have not been so far employed in the public service to the fullest extent, what would really happen is, we shall be completely destroying the first proposition upon which we are all agreed, namely, that there shall be an equality of opportunity. Let me give an illustration. Supposing, for instance, reservations were made for a community or a collection of communities, the total of which came to something like 70 per cent of the total posts under the State and only 30 per cent are retained as the unreserved. Could anybody say that the reservation of 30 per cent as open to general competition would be satisfactory from the point of view of giving effect to the first principle, namely, that there shall be equality of opportunity? It cannot be in my judgment. Therefore the seats to be reserved, if the reservation is to be consistent with Sub-clause (1) of Article 10, must be confined to a minority of seats. It is then only that the first principle could find its place in the Constitution and effective in operation. If honourable Members understand this position that we have to safeguard two things, namely, the principle of equality of opportunity and at the same time satisfy the demand of communities which have not had so far representation in the State, then, I am sure they will agree that unless you use some such qualifying phrase as ""backward"" the exception made in favour of reservation will ultimately eat up the rule altogether. Nothing of the rule will remain. That I think if I may say so, is the justification why the Drafting Committee undertook on its own shoulders the responsibility of introducing the word ""backward"" which, I admit, did not originally find a place in the fundamental right in the way in which it was passed by this Assembly....



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.",

undertakes “duties and responsibilities” the scope of which depends  on  his
situation and the technical means he uses.  The Court cannot  overlook  such
a person’s “duties” and “responsibilities” when  it  enquires,  as  in  this
case,  whether  “restrictions”  or  “penalties”  were   conducive   to   the
“protection  of  morals”  which  made  them  “necessary”  in  a  “democratic
society”.”

      Mr. Subramanium,  learned  senior  counsel  has  emphasised  that  the
freedom of expression as protected by Article 10  of  ECHR  constitutes  an
essential basis of a democratic society and any limitations on that  freedom
have to be interpreted strictly.   Mr. Subramanium has also referred  us  to
Editorial Board of Pravoye Delo and  Shtekel  v.  Ukraine[38],  wherein  the
European Court, for the first time, acknowledged that  Article 10  of  ECHR
has to be interpreted as imposing on States a positive obligation to  create
an appropriate  regulatory  framework  to  ensure  effective  protection  of
journalists’ freedom of expression on the Internet.  He has also  drawn  our
attention to Akda v. Turkey[39], wherein the European Court  has  held  that
ban on translation of classic work  of  literature  that  contained  graphic
description of sex, violated the right to freedom of expression.



32.   Mr. Nariman, learned senior counsel and amicus, has  commended  us  to
Wingrove v. United Kingdom[40] to show that  the  interpretation  placed  by
the European Court of Human Rights on Article 10 that deals with freedom  of
expression.  In the said case, a video movie characterising Saint Teresa  of
Avila in profane ways was held to be properly banned and not a violation  of
Article 10 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights.   The  said  case
originated from an application lodged with  the  European  Commission  under
Article 25 by a British national Nigel Wingrove on  18th  June,  1990.   The
object of the request and of the Application was to obtain a decision as  to
whether the facts of the case disclosed a breach  by  the  respondent  State
(United Kingdom) of its obligation under Article 10 of the  ECHR.   Wingrove
wrote the script  for a video and directed making of a video  work  entitled
‘visions of ecstasy’ – the idea for the film was derived from the  life  and
writings of St. Teresa of Avila, the sixteenth century  Carmelite,  nun  and
founder of many convents,  who  experienced  powerful  ecstatic  visions  of
Jesus Christ.  In paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report  it is stated:-



“... I consider that  the  same  decision  could  have  been  reached  under
paragraph 2 of Article 10 (art. 10-2) on grounds other than  blasphemy,  for
example the profanation of symbols, including  secular  ones  (the  national
flag) or jeopardising or prejudicing public order (but not for  the  benefit
of a religious majority in the territory concerned).  The reasoning  should,
in my opinion have been expressed in terms both of religious beliefs and  of
philosophical convictions.  It is only in paragraph 53 of the judgment  that
the words “any other” are cited.  Profanation and  serious  attacks  on  the
deeply held feelings of others or on religious  or  secular  ideals  can  be
relied on under Article 10 para 2  (art.  102)  in  addition  to  blasphemy.



“The majority of the Video Appeals Committee took the view that the  imagery
led not to a religious perception, but to a perverse one, the ecstasy  being
furthermore of a perverse kind.  That analysis was in  conformity  with  the
approach of the House of Lords, which moreover did not discuss the  author’s
intention with respect to the moral element of  the  offence.   The  Board’s
Director said that it would have taken just the same stance in respect of  a
film that was contemptuous of Mohammed  or  Buddha.   The  decision  not  to
grant a certificate  might possibly have been justifiable and justified  if,
instead of St Teresa’s ecstasies, what had been in issue had  been  a  video
showing, for example, the anti-clerical  Voltaire  having  sexual  relations
with some prince or king.  In such a case,  the  decision  of  the  European
Court might well have been similar  to  that  in  the  Wingrove  case.   The
rights of other under Article 10 para 2 (art.  10-2)  cannot  be  restricted
solely to the protection of the rights of others in  a  single  category  of
religious believers or philosophers, or a majority of them.  The  Court  was
quite right to base its decision on the protection of the rights  of  others
pursuant to Article 10 (art. 10), but to my mind it could have  done  so  on
broader grounds, inspired to a greater extent by the concern to protect  the
context of religious beliefs “or any other”, as is rightly  pointed  out  in
paragraph 53 of the judgment.  In the difficult balancing exercise that  has
to be carried out in these  situations  where  religious  and  philosophical
sensibilities are confronted by freedom of expression, it is important  that
the inspiration provided by the European Convention and  its  interpretation
should be based both on pluralism and a sense of values.”",
Article 10,"Ministry Of Defence, Government Of ... vs Cenrex Sp. Z.O.O & Ors. on 8 December, 2015",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/26155961/?formInput=Article%2010,,"(iii)   Petitioner not only had wrongly invoked the performance bond

and recovered moneys, but also the moneys thus received could have been

retained by the petitioner only if the petitioner was able to establish its case

of damages caused to it as per Article 10 of the Contract. However since the

pleadings of the petitioner filed in the arbitration proceedings did not base

itself on Article 10 of the Contract, hence, damages could not be claimed by

the petitioner under Article 10 for being adjusted against the performance

bond amount realized by the petitioner.


16.             The third conclusion given by the majority Award is that there

is no reference in the pleadings of the petitioner filed in the arbitration

proceedings to Article 10 of the Contract and therefore a claim based of the

petitioner on Article 10 is against law and cannot be looked at. These

conclusions are contained in paras 21 to 24 of the impugned Award and

these paras read as under:-

      ""21.       However, that it not to say that MOD would not, in the ordinary
      course, be entitled up to $82,245.14 in damages from Cenrex for breach of
      contract if Cenrex did fail to comply with the delivery schedule. Such a right
      to damages arises under Article 10, and clearly survives the expiry of the
      performance bond. The fact that MOD cannot rely upon the performance bond
      as a remedy does not mean that it is not entitled to bring a claim under Article
10 for liquidated damages.



      23.        Much of the agreement addressed on the pleadings does go to
      whether there was a breach of contract by Cenrex and, implicitly therefore, a
      right to damages under Article 10. Article 10 itself, however (like Article 2.3),
      does not feature at all in any of the pleadings of the parties. Latter submissions
      have sought to raise it, but the context in which those submissions are made is
      unclear and the tribunal does not consider that it is properly seized of any
      claim under Article 10.



OMP No.408/2007                                                              page 27 of 42
    24.       The tribunal therefore considers that it is bound to deal with this
   matter by allowing the claim of Cenrex and ordering payment of $82,245.14
   together with interest. The tribunal considers that interest should run from 19
   June 2004 at an annual rate of 18%.""                          (emphasis is mine)


17(i)        Once again this aforesaid conclusion and finding of the

Arbitration Tribunal is wholly perverse to say the least because even if

Article 10 of the Contract is not mentioned by reference, the entire case of

the petitioner in the arbitration proceedings has been the entitlement of the

petitioner to encash the performance bond on account of delay in deliveries

by the respondent no.1 to the petitioner and this is so stated by the Arbitrator

themselves in para 23 first line and para 22 first line of the impugned Award.

There is no law which requires that unless Article 10 of the Contract is

mentioned in the pleadings of the petitioner in the arbitration proceedings,

although the facts so as to bring the case under Articles 2.1, 2.2 and 10 of the

Contract are mentioned in the pleadings itself, it is not legally permissible

for the petitioner to urge a case for encashment and enforcement of the

performance bond on account of delays caused by the respondent no.1 in

supplying of goods under the contract.             The majority Award clearly

therefore has acted against the settled legal principles as applicable in this

country by holding that the petitioner herein was not entitled to plead a case

merely because Article 10 of the Contract is not mentioned in its pleadings

OMP No.408/2007                                                       page 28 of 42
 because the substance has to be seen and not the form and the form was also

there except the mention of Article 10.",

Article 10

 


Mr. Vice-President: We can now go back to Article No.10. The motion before the 
House is:

""That Article 10 form part of the Constitution.""

I shall now go over the amendments and then we may have a general discussion.

Amendment No. 326 is verbal and is disallowed.



Sir, my third argument is that the provision withregard to the reservation of 
seats in the legislatures for the minor ities, which must include the 
depressed classes and the scheduled tribes, according to the draft 
constitution isto be of limited duration. Now nobody can deny at thepresent 
time that a provision of this kind is necessary for these classes and it must 
be obvious to everybody here thatrepresentation in the legislature is of far 
greaterimportance than representation in services. If a communityis 
represented in the legislature, its representatives canvoice its demands from 
time to time and can see that anyinjustice done to that community either in 
the matter ofappointment to posts or in any other matter is rectified.But if 
it ceases to be represented in the legislature,whatever protection might be 
granted to it in this or thatmatter, it will be in a far more helpless 
condition than ifit were deprived of any other special aid. Now it has 
beenprovided in the Constitution that the reservation of seatsfor the minor 
ities which include the scheduled tribes anddepressed classes, who must 
according to any definition beregarded as backward, is limited to ten years. 
Article 305lays down that the provision for the reservation of seatsfor the 
minor ities which include the scheduled tribes anddepressed classes, who must 
according to any definition beregarded as backward, is limited to ten years. 
Article 305lays down that the provision for the reservation of seatsfor the 
minor ities according to their population shallcontinue in force unchanged for 
ten years and no more. Onthe expiration of then years from the commencement of 
the Constitution this ""provision shall lapse unless it soperation is 
extended by an amendment of the Constitution.Now is it not desirable that a 
similar limitation should bellaid down in clause (3) of article 10? Indeed it 
can beapplied with greater force to article 10 than to thereservation of posts 
for the minor ities in the Central andProvincial administrations. If clause 
(3) of article 10 isto be in comformity with the scheme for the protection of 
the interests of the backward classes, I submit that it is not merely 
desirable but necessary that the amendment that Ihave proposed should be made.



Lastly, Sir, I should like to know what is therelationship between clause (3) 
of article 10 and article296. Article 296 provides that the claims of minor 
itycommunities shall be taken into consideration consistentlywith the 
maintenance of efficiency in the administration in the making of appointments 
to services and posts inconnection with the affairs of the Union or of a State 
for the time being specified in Part I of the First Schedule.Now in so far as 
clause (3) of Article 10 applies to allStates specified in the First Schedule, 
the differencebetween it and article 296, which applies only to 
Statesspecified in Part I of the First Schedule, is clear. Butbeyond that it 
is far from clear what the relationshipbetween these two articles is. Article 
296 relates tominor ities. The claims of the minor ity communities can betaken 
into consideration in making appointments to servicesonly on the ground that 
they are backward. Though it is the word `minor ity' that is used, in article 
296 and theexpression `backward classes' is used in article 10 (3), itseems to 
me that in fairness to the country protection canbe granted to any class, 
whether you call it a backwardclass or a minor ity, only on the ground that it 
is backwardand if left to itself, would be unable to protect itsinterests. 
This shows the need for

 


clearing up theconnection between the two articles that I have justreferred 
to. Apart from this, I should like to know whetherif clause (3) of article 10 
were passed, it would bepossible for sections within the various communities 
to askfor special protection for themselves in the matter ofappointments to 
services or posts. It may be that if clause(3) of article 10 is passed, it 
will not be possible for theState to make any reservations in the services 
forminor ities as such. But will it not be a temptation tosections of these 
and other communities to claim that theyare backward in order to get the 
protection of clause (3) ofarticle 10? Sir, I submit that we should have a 
system thatwould not encourage fissiparous tendencies and under whichit will 
not be to the interest of any class to claim that it is backward. It is 
desirable therefore to limit theoperation of any special protection that we 
may grant--protection of whatever kind--that its duration should belimited, so 
that the legislature may from time to time beable to see how it has worked and 
how the State hasdischarged its duty towards the protected classes. Unlessthis 
is done, I venture to think that article 10 would notbe in conformity with the 
intention of the constitution toremove all those conditions on account of 
which specialprotection is necessary. We are all aware that when theReport of 
the Minor ities Committee was considered by theHouse, the entire House was 
anxious that reservations of whatever kind should be done away with as quickly 
aspossible. It was recognized that for the time being theywere necessary, but 
it was insisted on that whateverprotection might be considered necessary now, 
should begranted temporarily only, so that the population of thecountry might 
become fully integrated, and no community orclass might be tempted to claim 
special advantages for itself. On these grounds, Sir, I venture to put forward 
myamendment though I have no doubt whatsoever, that it willnot find favour 
with my friend Dr. Ambedkar.



To give a clear picture of this, Sir, I would like tostate what obtains in 
Mysore. There are two classes ofvacancies, A and B classes. For the A Class 
vacancies, boththe Brahmins and the Non-Brahmins are competent to 
apply,whereas for the B class vacancies, only the backward classesare entitled 
to compete. Sir, these backward communitiessuffer from two disabilities, 
namely, social disabilitiesand educational disabilities. It is from these two 
points ofview, that the State Government has specifically providedthe 
appointments in the B class. Therefore, Sir, it is butright that the word 
""backward"" appearing in clause (3) ofarticle 10 should be retained. 
As the Honourable Dr.Ambedkar has rightly said, the retention of the 
word`backward' will be very appropriate also for this reason,namely, that 
clauses (1) and (2) of article 10 would be nulland void if this word 
`backward' is not retained in clause(3) of article 10.",

which supply was cut down due to any law, and APRL was not

allocated coal block, and its bid was premised on the imported coal.

In Energy Watchdog, it was opined that only changes in Indian law

could be considered under the PPA and not in foreign law. In NCDP

dated 26.7.2013, the NCDP of 2007 was modified to the effect that

power projects would only get a certain percentage of what was earlier

allowable.


54.   It is apparent from the decision dated 31.5.2013 of the Standing

Linkage Committee (Long­Term) that the application of APRL was kept

in abeyance. It applied for coal linkage on 2.7.2009 on the basis of

NCDP of 2007. The bid cut­off date was 30.7.2009, 7 days prior to the

bid deadline, the NCDP of 2007 was applicable. A decision was taken

by the Standing Linkage Committee on 14.2.2012 read with the

decision dated 31.5.2013 indicating a shortage in domestic coal and

dependence on imported coal. For the shortage of coal, APRL could

not have been made to suffer, on that it had no control.       It was

decided not to issue fresh LoAs, and all pending applications were

kept in abeyance.     The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs



decided on 21.6.2013 to reduce coal supply to 65 percent and 75

percent of ACQ for the remaining four years of the 12 th Five Year Plan.

It allowed passing through of higher cost of imported coal.                   The

Ministry of Coal was directed to suitably amend the NCDP.                     The

Ministry of Coal on 26.7.2013 amended the NCDP of 2007, and the

Ministry of Power issued a letter on 31.7.2013, which provided for

pass­through    of    additional    cost   incurred    to    meet    the      coal

requirements.      The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its

decision   dated     21.6.2013,    recognised   coal    supply,     subject     to

availability, to 4660 MW having no fuel linkage.            The Kawai Project

was included in the same.         The Policy was revised, thus assurance

given by the Government of India under the NCDP of 2007 was taken

away. The provision of 100 per cent supply was taken away. With

respect to the applicability of Energy Watchdog, a dispute has been

raised. In Energy Watchdog, it was laid down that change in law is

applicable to change in domestic law, not change in foreign law. It is

not applicable to imported coal/change in foreign law. It was urged

that application for grant of coal linkage was submitted to the Ministry

of Coal for the supply of coal in the light of assurance given under the

NCDP of 2007 in both the cases and those assurances, which were

given in the Policy, were diluted or taken away by the subsequent

scheme of the Government instrumentality.             Consequently, no coal



linkage or LoA or FSA was available in the hands of the Generator in

Energy Watchdog. The cut­off date for applicability of law was 7 days

prior to the bid deadline and change in law provision of Article 10 of

the PPA in question is similar to Article 13 of the PPA in Energy

Watchdog. Article 10 is extracted hereunder:



        “ARTICLE 10: CHANGE IN LAW

        10.1 Definitions
        In this Article 10, the following terms shall have the
        following meanings:

 10.1.1 ""Change in Law"" means the occurrence of any of

10.2 Application and Principles for computing impact
of Change in Law

10.2.1 While determining the consequence of Change in
Law under this Article 10, the Parties shall have due
regard to the principle that the purpose of compensating
the Party affected by such Change in Law, is to restore
through monthly Tariff Payment, to the extent
contemplated in this Article 10, the affected Party to the
same economic position as if such Change in Law has not
occurred.

10.3 Relief for Change in Law
10.3.1 During Construction Period
As a result of any Change in Law, the impact of
increase/decrease of Capital Cost of the Power Station in
the Tariff shall be governed by the formula given below:



         “15.6.2 Except as provided in this Agreement, all prior
         written or oral understandings, offers or other
         communications of every kind pertaining to this
         Agreement or supply of power up to the Contracted
         Capacity under this Agreement to the Procurers by the
         Seller shall stand superseded and abrogated.”


63.   Article 10 of the PPA is clearly attracted that the change in law

was in contemplation.     Article 10 cannot be made redundant; the

agreement is binding and must prevail.",
Article 10,"State Of West Bengal vs Brindaban Chandra Pramanik And Anr. on 24 July, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1819442/?formInput=Article%2010,,"34. I hold, therefore,   that Article 10   and not Art, 9 is the residuary article, that the words ""other financial obligations"" must be read ejusdem generis with the words ""loans, guarantees"" which precede the same and should be given a restricted and technical meaning, namely, financial obligations of the nature of ""loans"" and ""guarantees"", and that the said expression would not  include non-contractual liabilities e.g. statutory liabilities for compensation for compulsory levy, requisition or acquisition. I hold further that the phrase ""actionable wrong"" which occurs   in Article 10 should   receive a wide and liberal interpretation and should be held to connote  all infringements of legal rights,  for which an action lies in law. Thus read, this Article 10 would obviously include torts and breaches of contract, which would be only two of the species, of which ""actionable wrong"" is the genus but would not, by or between themselves, exhaust the whole of it. ""Actionable wrong"" would have other categories and the present case affords one such illustration. In Article 10, however, ""breach of contract"" (which has already been provided for in Article 8 and Article 9, as above interpreted)   has been   expressly excluded and so  that Article would apply to all actionable wrongs other than ""breach of contract."" In this view, Article 10(2) (b) would clearly cover the disputed claim and the appellants cannot shake off their liability for the same.



B. K. Mukherjea J. further observed as follows:
  ""The word 'wrong' in ordinary legal language means and signifies 'privation of right'. An act is wrongful if it infringes the legal right of another, and 'actionable' means nothing else than that it affords grounds for action in law"". 

47. On this observation of B. K. Mukherjea J., Mr. Dutt appearing for the respondent    has relied and has urged that as the respondent has been kept out of the money due to him as compensation for the goods requisitioned he has suffered a wrong and as this affords a ground for action in law it is an actionable wrong and therefore Article 10. interpreted widely as the Supreme Court intended it to be interpreted, would cover the claim in the present case and therefore the liability would be that of the province   of West Bengal.    It is however difficult to accept the proposition that the mere omission to pay the statutory compensation would amount to an  actionable wrong as contemplated, in Article 10.    The suit is directly a suit for recovery of statutory compensation and not for damages in respect of an actionable wrong in the way of withholding proper compensation.   The Supreme Court decision shows that for a case to come under Article 10 there must be some wrongful act, some illegal and unauthorised act done.   The requisitioning of paddy was not an illegal or unauthorised act -- it was an act under statutory power.   It is therefore difficult to see how the claim for statutory compensation can be a liability in respect of an actionable wrong.    To bring  such a  claim within the scope of Article 10 by contending that it is really a suit for damages for an actionable wrong, to wit, withholding the payment of the compensation, appears to be to stretch the scope of Article 10 unduly; if Article 10 be used for every case in which payment is withheld, there would be no need for Article 9.



59. The Indian Independence (Rights, property and Liabilities) Order was promulgated by the Governor-General of British India under powers conferred on him by Section 9 (1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 for making an initial distribution of the assets and liabilities of undivided India and undivided Provinces between the two Dominions and the new Provinces which came into existence under that Act. The liabilities of the undivided Province of Bengal were distributed by Articles 8 (2), 9 (b) and 10 (2) of the Order. Article 8 in express terms deals with contractual liability; Article 9 read with Article 8 (6) leads to the conclusion that ""liabilities in respect of loans, guarantees and other financial obligations"" of the Province of Bengal which were outstanding before the appointed day, are also a special class of contractual liabilities; and then Article 10 deals with a liability in respect of an ""actionable wrong other than a breach of contract"". It is not disputed that the classification of liabilities made by Articles 8, 9 and 10 is exhaustive, so that whatever is not dealt with by Articles 8 & 9 comes under Article 10. In the case of  notice was served upon the Manager of the Tripura State under the Bengal Agri. Income-tax Act calling upon him to submit a return of agricultural income received by him during the previous year. The Ruler of the State then instituted a suit in June, 1946 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca for a declaration that the aforesaid Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income-tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void and for an injunction restraining the defendant from proceeding with the assessment. The suit was transferred from the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Dacca to the Court of a Subordinate Judge, 24-Parganas. After partition of Bengal the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the place of Province of Bengal and it raised a plea that the Court of Alipur being situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to try the suit. The trial Court overruled the plea, but in revision this Court reversed the decision of the trial Court upon the view that Article 10 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order, 1947 applied to tortious acts (See the decision of this Court in Province of East Bengal v. State of Tripura, 53 Cal WN 368 at p. 380) (K). On appeal the Supreme Court held that the interpretation of the expression ""actionable wrong"" as given by this Court was too narrow. The judgment of the Supreme Court is .  Patanjali Sastri J. in delivering the majority judgment observed as follows;



61. The learned Additional Government Pleader has strenuously contended before me that as the paddy was requisitioned in pursuance of a statutory authority conferred by Rule 75-A of the Defence of India Rules and as those Rules have not been challenged by the plaintiffs as ultra vires it cannot be regarded as an actionable wrong within the meaning of Article 10. It is pointed out that in the Tripura case the plaintiff challenged the constitutional validity of the Bengal Agricultural income-tax Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability on the plaintiff and as in the present case there is no challenge to the validity of the Defence of India Rules, the wrong complained of by the plaintiff cannot be said to be an actionable wrong within the meaning of Article 10. To my mind it is nothing but a confusion of thought to suggest that the plaintiffs in the present case are complaining of requisition of paddy. They do not and cannot challenge the requisition; their cause of action is based on the infringement of their statutory right to get compensation under Clause (4) of Rule 75-A. The only question therefore is whether the failure to pay statutory compensation is an actionable wrong and upon a true interpretation of that expression in the light of the observations made by the Supreme Court in the Tripura case I have no doubt that it is. This conclusion is also borne out by the decisions of this Court in the following cases; Khagendra Nath v. State of West Bengal,  (Das and Das Gupta JJ.); Ramesh Chandra Das v. Province of Bengal,  (M) (Das and P. N. Mookerjee JJ.) and Hindusthan Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd, v. State of West Bengal 59 Cal WN 405 (N) (Bose J.). In Khagendra Nath Ganguli's case (L) the suit was for a declaration that the assessment of revenue upon land was illegal and for an injunction restraining the Province of Bengal from enforcing the liability and it was held that such a suit was with respect to a liability of the Province of Bengal for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and as such is governed by Article 10 (2) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947. In the case of Ramesh Chandra Das the suit was for a declaration that an order of discharge from service served upon the plaintiff by the Province of Bengal was illegal and for a further declaration that the plaintiff might be deemed to be still in service. Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Tripura case (E), Das and P. N. Moo-kerjee JJ. held that the plaintiff's claim was based on a liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract, as envisaged by Article 10 (2) of the aforesaid Order of 1947. The case of Hindusthan Housing and Land Development Trust Ltd. (N), is directly in point as there is nothing to distinguish the facts of that case from the facts of the case before me. In that case the plaintiff company was the owner of certain lands in 24-Parganas. On 21-6-46, the then Government of Bengal requisitioned the lands. On or about 30-6-1947 the Land Acquisition Collector. 24-Parganas fixed and offered to pay Rs. 4,641/- per month as compensation in respect of the said lands with effect from 29-6-1946 and the plaintiff agreed to it. On 15-5-1947 the Collector sanctioned payment of the pre-partition claim then due. The State of West Bengal, however, did not pay the compensation for the period 29-6-46 to 14-8-47 on the ground that under Article 9 (b) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947 it was the liability of the Province of East Bengal, Upon these facts Bose J. held that the non-fulfilment of the statutory obligation to pay compensation is a liability in respect of an actionable wrong under Article 10 (2) (b). In interpreting the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Tripura case (E) his Lordship observes as follows at page 411.",

 In this case also, it is nto necessary to reproduce the contents of column 3. Suffice it to say that the court-fee is a fixed amount. The short argument on behalf of the appellant is that the present appeal is nto from a decree or from an order having the force of a decree and, therefore, it falls within Article 11 of Schedule Ii and nto within Article 1, Schedule I, which, for our purpose, is a residuary Article. It is added that reading these two Articles together it must follow that Article 1, Schedule I, so far as appeals are concerned, is confined only to appeals from decrees and orders having the force of decrees. The cogency of this argument depends on the meaning of the word ""judgment"" used in section 10 of the Act. No decision directly covering the construction of this section has been brought to our notice, but by way of analogy, reference has been made to the decisions construing the meaning of the word 'Judgment' occurring in clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the High Court of Judicature at Lahore and in clause 15 of the Letters Patent constituting the High Courts of Judicature at Calcutta and Bombay. Reference has also been made to the definitions of the words ""judgment"" and ""decree"" contained in section 2 (9) and (2) respectively of the Civil P. C. We shall have to see, among other things, as to how far these definitions are helpful in construing the word ""judgment"" as used in section 10 of the Act.  



 5. We have arrived at this conclusion on the plain reading of section 10 of the Act in the background of the statutory scheme. In our view, the draftsman could neither have intended to restrict the right of appeal only to final judgments disposing of the entire suit, nor could he have intended it to extend to all orders made during the course of trial, however ministerial or procedural in their nature or ineffectual on the rights of the parties.  

 6. For the purpose of court-fee also therefore, the Court will have to consider in each case whether the judgment falls within the contemplation of Article 11, Schedule Ii, because of its nto amounting to a decree in the sense of finally disposing of a suit or an order having the force of a decree or whether it is a judgment which, without so amounting, otherwise materially affects the rights of the parties so as to give rise to a right of appeal under Section 10 of the Act. It may be observed that in the case in hand, the competency of the appeal is nto in question, and indeed it is common ground that the judgment is appealable. The only question which arises for our consideration is whether the present is an appeal from a decree or from an order having the force of a decree or whether it is an appeal from a judgment which is neither a decree nor an order having the force of a decree. It is also contended at the bar that the Court-fees Act, being a fiscal statute, unless it clearly falls within Article 1, Schedule I, which provides for ad valorem court-fee, this Court must give benefit 9f doubt to the citizen and hold that a fixed court-fee is payable in this case under Article 11, Schedule II. This argument seems to us to be somewhat misconceived. If the judgment does nto fall within the plain meaning of Article 11, Schedule Ii, then appeal, which is admittedly competent, would be governed by Article 1. Schedule I.  




 7. In the present case, the judgment has indisputably disposed of the suit finally, with the result that nothing more remains to be done in the trial of the suit. Whether a decree is also to be framed in agreement with the judgment under the Civil P. C. is, in our opinion, immaterial because the Act does nto take notice of decrees and in terms it provides for appeals only from judgments. The judgment under appeal, however, conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to the matters in controversy in the suit and it embodies in itself the formal expression of the adjudication. Merely because as a result of the adjudication, it purports also to grant a decree, would nto deprive the judgment of the characteristics of a decree for the purposes of Court Fees Act. This judgment must, therefore, be held to amount to a decree and, therefore, excluded from the operation of Article 11, Schedule II. The Act, it may be remembered, does nto define either ""judgment"" or ""decree"". It merely makes the judgment appealable under Section 10. To be appealable, as hereinbefore discussed, the judgment, broadly stated, must be more than a mere statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order; in other words, it must contain or embody a decision on a dispute affecting the merits as well. In the case before us, the judgment also contains all the criteria of a decree and this indeed is nto contested. We are, therefore inclined to hold that this case quite clearly falls within the purview of Article 1, Schedule I and is subject to payment of ad valorem court-fee.  



 8. The learned Counsel for the parties have cited a number of decisions with the object of showing that the judgment can neither amount to a decree nor to an order having the force of a decree and that, therefore, the present case must necessarily fall within Art. 11. Sch, II. We do nto consider it necessary to refer in details to all the cases cited because none of them deals with the Act. The decisions dealing with clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court and clause 15 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta and Bombay High Courts, do seem to be of some assistance, but few of them deal with the question of court-fee, with the result that the ratio deci-dendi to most of these cases does nto throw much helpful light on the problem which we are called upon to solve. Without elaborately commenting on them, we may merely notice them in passing' In Palaniappa v. M. R. Krishnamurthy,  (FB). an order granting leave to sue in forma pauperis was held to be a judgment and, therefore, appealable. In Rajinder Parshad v. Punjab State,  (FB), an order dismissing a writ petition on the ground of delay was held to be a judgment subject to appeal under clause 10 of the Letters Patent. In Mohd. Felumeah v. S. Mondal, , it was observed that a judgment within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent (Calcutta) could nto be construed as a decree under the Civil P. C. and an ad interim injunction during the pendency of writ proceedings was held to amount to a ""judgment"". In Union of India v. Khetra Mohan, . there is an exhaustive discussion on the test as to what is a final and what is an interlocutory judgment. In that case, a suit was brought by the plaintiff on the original side of the Calcutta High Court against the Union of India for a sum of money. The trial Judge, after recording his decision on several issues, directed a reference for the ascertainment of the amount due and payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. The referee was directed (i) to take accounts on the footing of certain measurements for ascertainment of the amount due to the plaintiff; (ii) to determine the market rate for items of work done by the plaintiff and (iii) to ascertain whether there had been an increase in the rate of labour charges in respect of certain excess quantity of work done. In an appeal preferred by the defendant, an objection was taken by the plaintiff that the decision of the trial Judge was nto a judgment. It was held that so far as direction (i) was concerned, it should be held to be a 'judgment' within clause 15 of the Letters Patent and the order should be considered as a whole and it amounted to a preliminary decree and thus a 'judgment' within the meaning of clause 15 of the Letters Patent. On this reasoning, it was held appealable on the basis of a decision of the Privy Council in Ahmed Musaji Saleji v. Hasham Ebra-him Saleji, 2nd 42 Cal 914 : (AIR 1915 Pc 116). In Sultan Singh v. Jai Chand, 1966 Delhi Lt 62, a learned Single Judge of the Punjab High Court sitting on Circuit in Delhi, laid down that an order of the Rent Controller or the Rent Control Tribunal under the Delhi Rent Act, 1958 does nto become an order having the force of a decree merely because U is executable as a decree. The order, therefore, was held nto to fall within Article 7, Schedule I, Court Fees Act We do nto consider it necessary or proper to express any opinion on the correctness or otherwise of this view. Suffice it to say that this decision does nto throw much light on the question before us. According to the Supreme Court in Asrumati Debi v. Rupendra Deb, , an order for transfer of a suit under clause 13 of the Letters Patent of the Calcutta High Court is nto a ""judgment"" within the meaning of clause 15 and no appeal lies there from because it neither affects the merits of the controversy between the parties in the suit itself, nor terminates or disposes of the suit on any ground. In this judgment, there is illuminating discussion as to the meaning of the word ""judgment"". In State of U. P. v. Vijay Anand. , the order of a Division Bench dismissing an application for review of an order under Article 226 of the Constitution was held to be a ""judgment"" within the meaning of clause 10 of the Letters Patent of the Allahabad High Court. In the body of the judgment, the Court declined to reconcile the decisions of the Madras High Court on the one hand and those of Calcutta and Nagpur High Courts on the other on the interpretation of the word ""judgment."" It was, however, noticed that there was a cleavage of opinion of the scope of the expression ""judgment."" In Shankarlal v. Shankarlal Poddar, , it was observed that orders passed by the District Court or by a Single Judge of the Calcutta High Court in the matter of winding up petitions are appealable under section 202 of the Companies Act independently of the provisions of sections 96 and 104 of the Code or of clause 15 of the Letters Patent and tt would be sufficient if the order is judicial as distinguished from administrative or ministerial order. The Court left open the question of the scope of the expression ""judgment"" in the Letters Patent. In Taxing Officer v. Jamnadas Dharamdas, , a decree passed by the Tribunal under the Displaced Persons (Debts Adjustment) Act, 1951 made appealable under section 40 of that Act was held nto to amount to a decree within the meaning of the Court Fees Act. In any event, the award made by the Tribunal under that Act was nto regarded as a decree within the meaning of Schedule Ii, Article 11, Court Fees Act, with the result that the memorandum of appeal filed under section 40 of that Act was held to fall for payment of court-fee, under Schedule Ii, Art 11. In Irshad Husain v. Bakshish Husain, Air 1946 Oudh 254, an order for quashing the proceedings under section 20, U. P, Encumbered Estates Act, was held nto to amount to an order having the force of a decree and was, therefore, governed by Schedule Ii, Article U. Court Fees Act. In Kanwar Jagat Bahadur Singh V. Punjab Slate, , an award of compensation made by an arbitrator acting under the Punjab Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act was held neither to amount to a decree nor an order having the force of a decree, with the result that an appeal against such an award was held to fall under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. In Official Liquidator v. M. U. Qureshj, Air 1945 Lah 146 (FB) an executable order made under the Companies Act of 1913, which is enforceable under section 199 thereof in the same manner as a decree, was held to fall for the purposes of court-fee under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. According to Gokal Chand v. Sanwal Das, Air 1920 Lah 326, the term 'judgment' in clause 10 of the Letters Patent (Lahore) includes any interlocutory judgment which decides, so far as the Court pronouncing the judgment is concerned, whether finally or temporarily. any question materially in issue between the parties and directly affecting the subject matter of the suit. In the reported case, an order on an application to stay execution pending appeal was held to be a judgment and, therefore, appealable. In Vastulal Pareek v. Pareek Commercial Bank Ltd., , an appeal against an order passed on a claim made by a Bank under section 45-B of the Banking Companies Act, after the commencement of its winding up proceedings, was held to fall, for purposes of court-fee, under Schedule II. Article 11, Court-fees Act. In Dundappa v. S. G. Motor Transport Co., (P) Ltd., Air 1966 Mys 150, an appeal against an order refusing to wind Up a company was held to be liable to court-fee under Article 11, Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act. In Kanak Sunder Bibi v. Ram Lakhan Pandey.  (FB), the word ""decision"" in Article 133(1) of the Constitution was held equivalent to the word ""decree"". In Ram Prasad v. Tirloki Nath. Air 1938 All 50, an order under section 5 (1), U. P. Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1934 was held nto to have the force of a decree and on appeal from such an order, Court-fee was payable under Article 11. Schedule Ii, Court Fees Act.",
Article 11,"Meyyappa Chettiar vs Chidambaram Chettiar on 17 December, 1923",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/937459/?formInput=Article%2011,,"7. Wallis, C. J., with whom Oldfield, Kumaraswami Sastri and Ramesam, JJ., agreed, stated that the property attached before Judgment does not become property attached in execution upon the passing of a decree for the plaintiff either within the meaning of Article 11 or under Order 21, Rule 57, and that Order 38, Rule 11, merely enables the decree-holder to apply for execution without a fresh attachment. But he held that where an order for sale was obtained, that order proceeds on the footing that the property is to be considered as attached in execution by virtue of Order 38, Rule 11, and that a claim put in after the order may properly be regarded as a claim to property attached in execution of the decree and therefore within Article 11 of the Limitation Act. It is to be observed that this change which the Court held occurs in the nature of the attachment only comes into operation according to this judgment when an order for sale is obtained. It does not hold that this change occurs either on obtaining a decree or on making an attempt to obtain an order for sale by issuing an execution petition. The case is therefore not any authority in favour of the present contention, because in this case there has not been any order for sale. It may be if there had been such an order that the position would be different. This judgment points out the anomalous result that if a claim is made to property attached before judgment up to the order of sale, a suit by the party affected is barred in six years, whereas, if it is made after the order of sale, it is barred in one year, and suggests that the anomaly should be put right by legislation. Emphasis was placed in the judgment on the fact that, before the limitation provisions in such cases were removed from the Code of Civil Procedure and put into the Limitation Act in 1908, there was express provision that the limitation period of one year should apply both in the case of claims to property attached in execution and to property attached before judgment, and it was thought that the Legislature could not have intended in the process of removing a section from the Code of Civil Procedure to the Limitation Act to extend the limitation period. The Court, however, was driven to the conclusion that it had done so, but confined the extension within the narrowest possible limits. No such consideration applies to this case, as the penal provision of Order 21, Rule 57, in question was, when enacted, entirely new. It is not without interest that the Court treated the meaning of Order 21, Rule 57, as not germane to the matter then in issue and that I.L.R. 42 M. 1 and the cases there quoted were not even mentioned in argument. Spencer, J., delivered a separate judgment in which he says that, if a decree is passed and an attempt is made to execute it, what was an attachment before judgment becomes in effect an attachment in execution of a decree because Order 38, Rule 11, declares that no re-attachment is necessary and, later on, he says he finds no difficulty in classing a claim put in after the properties were brought to sale in execution proceedings under the heading of "" Claims preferred to property attached in execution of a decree,"" and he declined to express an opinion on the hypothetical case of a claim put in to property attached before judgment before the decree and the commencement of the execution proceedings. I doubt if he meant by his judgment to go further than the rest of the Court, and to extend the principle enunciated by them to claims made where there was a decree but no execution proceedings, or to claims made after execution proceedings had been commenced. If he did so intend, his observations were obiter and I prefer the judgment of the rest of the Court, which in my judgment strained the language of the article in question in going even as far as it did. However this may be, 1 find nothing in that judgment when carefully examined which militates against the view expressed in I.L.R. 42 Mad 1, which I think was rightly decided. As there has been no order for sale in this case, and nothing but an abortive attempt to obtain, and for that purpose to make use of an existing attachment, it is not necessary here to decide what the position would be after an order for sale had been obtained. I can find nothing in the rule to make the failure to proceed expeditiously with the execution petition involve the loss of all rights acquired by the attachment before judgment. 1 would answer the question in the affirmative.



19. The first note of dissent from this view was struck in Gones Chandra v. Banwari Lal (1813) 16 CLJ 86. The learned Judges (one of whom was Sir Cecil Brett) dissent from I.L.R. 12 Bom. 400 and I.L.R. 33 Cal. 639. The decision in I.L.R. 29 Cal. 773 (in which Brett, J., was one of the Judges) was not referred to nor is the closely connected question, the possibility of the conversion of an attachment before Judgment into one in execution, discussed. This decision was referred to in Bavuddin Sahib v. Arunachala Mudali (1913) 26 MLJ 215, where their Lordships say: ""The other contention of the appellant, namely, that....the present decree-holder converted the attachment before Judgment into an attachment in execution is not sustainable. Such conversion can take place only if the decree-holder applies for sale of all the properties in execution of his own decree. Whether such conversion will take place even in such a case may be questioned on the authority of Gones, Chandra v. Banwari Lal (1912) 16 CLJ 86, but it is unnecessary to decide that question for the purposes of this case. "" This decision far from being an authority in favour of the respondent is, as the expression of an opinion, against him. It is true the last sentence above quoted leaves the point before us open. But the immediately preceding sentence indicates the view that the attachment before Judgment will be converted into one in execution on the application of the decree-holder for sale. The next case supposed to be in favour of the respondent is Suraparaju v. Narasimham (1914) 1 LW 932. It does not appear from the facts that any application for execution was dismissed for default. There was no reference either in the argument or in the Judgment to Order 21, Rule 57, or to the cases above discussed. The next decision relied on by the respondent is Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1. It purports to be based on 16 Call. L. J. 86, 26 M.L.J. 215 and I L. W. 932. The last two decisions are scarcely authorities for it. So that, we have, as against the decisions and opinions that prevailed from 1869 to 1911, two decisions in 1912 and 1918 in favour of the respondent. In this state of the authorities we got the decision in Arunachalam Chetti v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 : 41 MLJ 256 (FB); here the question arose with reference to the words "" attached in execution of a decree"" in Article 11 of the Limitation Act. A Full Bench of five Judges held that, after an order for sale was passed after the decree, an attachment before Judgment becomes an attachment in execution. Wallis, C. J., said referring to Order 38, Rule 11: ""This provision does not, in my opinion, enable us to say that property attached before Judgment becomes property attached in execution of a decree upon the mere passing of a decree for plaintiff either within the meaning of Article 11 of the Limitation Act or Order 21, Rule 57, already mentioned, as execution may never be applied for, but merely enables the decree-holder to apply for execution by sale of the attached property without a fresh attachment. Where, however, as in the present case, there is an order in execution for the sale of the attached property, that order appears to me to proceed upon the footing that the property is to be considered as attached in execution by virtue of Rule 11, etc. "" This was concurred by three other Judges (of whom I was one). Spencer, J., though he may be regarded as going further than the others, certainly agreed with them to the extent that, at least after the order for sale, the attachment before Judgment becomes one in execution. The Judgment is therefore an unanimous Judgment of five Judges laying down an attachment before Judgment may be converted into an attachment in execution of a decree and is binding on this Court; and when we remember that the Limitation Act and Civil Procedure Code are allied General Acts (first passed together in 1859, again in 1877 and again in 1908) and ought to be construed consistently [See Phoolbas Koonwar v. Lalla Jogeshar Sahoy (1875) ILR 1 C 226 at 242 (PC) and Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 at 909], it is seen that it will be a great anomaly without any justification if the same expression is construed in one way in Section 63 of the Civil Procedure Code and Article 11 of the Limitation Act and in another way for Order 21, Rule 57, of the C. P. Code. If the character of an attachment before Judgment is such that its conversion into an attachment in execution is impossible, such impossibility exists equally for the purpose of Section 63, C. P. C, and Article 11 of the Limitation Act as for Order 21, Rule 57. Unless there is a clear indication to the contrary in one or more of these provisions, the possibility of such conversion equally applies to all and I see no reason to depart from ILR 44 Mad. 902, which definitely established the possibility of such conversion.



37. The petitioner relies strongly upon the ruling reported in Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 MLJ 256 (FB), which laid down that Article 11 of the Indian Limitation Act, which deals with the question of the limitation period for an order on a claim petition preferred to "" property attached in execution of a decree, "" applies to an order on a claim petition preferred to property attached before Judgment after an order for sale in execution had been passed. Three points have to be noted with reference to this case; first, that it was a case of a claim made after decree, after an application for execution had been put in and after an order for sale in execution had been passed; secondly, that Section 246 of the old Civil Procedure Code of 1859, which the Judges held to be the fous et origo of Article 11 of the Indian Limitation Act, applied expressly in terms to an attachment before Judgment as well as to an attachment in execution; and thirdly, that they were oppressed by the facts that, despite the provisions of the old Code, the legislature had provided no special period of limitation at all for claims to property attached before Judgment, and that, unless ""the whole object of the summary claim procedure"" was to be "" frustrated, "" a briefer period of limitation than that in Article 120 had to be found somewhere. The learned Chief Justice and the other learned Judges, who adopted his Judgment in that case, considered that they "" should not be justified in laying down generally that property attached before Judgment is attached in execution of a decree"" and they distinctly held that Order 21, Rule 57, threw no light on the point that had been then argued before them. I do not think this ruling goes further than to say that a claim put in after there is an order in execution for sale following upon on attachment before Judgment "" may properly be regarded as a claim to property attached in execution of a decree within the meaning of Article 11 "" of the Limitation Act. It cannot, therefore, be construed to lay down that in all instances where the phrase "" property attached in execution "" occurs in any statute, it covers cases of property attached before judgment as soon as execution is taken out on the decree arising out of that judgment; it must, in my opinion in view of the compulsion, if it may be so called, exercised over their Lordships' minds, by the omissions of the Legislature, be strictly confined to what it lays down. I cannot, therefore, read into it a reversal of the decision in Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1. That is a direct authority in favour of the respondent in this case, to which one of the learned Judges in the I.L.R., 44 Madras case was a party, and other direct authorities quoted therein are Gones Chandra Adak v. Banwari Lal Roy (1912) 16 CLJ 86 and Bavuddin Sahib v. Arunachala Mudali, (1913) 26 MLJ 235 and another case, which indirectly is in favour of the respondent, Kosuri Suraparaju v. Mandapaka Narasimham, reported in 26 I. C, 81.



41. There is authority on both sides. In Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata Seshaiya (1918) ILR 42 M 1 it was held that Order 21, Rule 57, had no application to attachments before judgment. The Judges followed one Calcutta and two Madras decisions on the point The Calcutta case [Gones Chandra Adak v. Banwari Lal Roy (1912) 16 CLJ 86 is certainly a direct authority in support of their view. One of the Madras cases (Bavuddin Sahib v. Aruna-chala Mudali (1913) 26 MLJ 215 is--if anything--an authority for the opposite view. What it actually decided was that an attachment before judgment did not cease to exist because an application for the arrest of the judgment-debtor had been dismissed for default. That is not in point here. Incidentally, however, the opinion was expressed that an attachment before judgment was converted into an attachment in execution where the decree-holder applied in execution for sale of the attached property. At the same time, a doubt was raised, with reference to the Calcutta decision, whether the opinion was correct, a doubt which the Judges expressly refrained from solving. The last case Kosuri Suraparaju v. Mandapaka Narasimham (1914) 1 LW 932 is not very clear. Apparently an execution application had been dismissed. If it was dismissed for default, the decision i:  a direct authority in support of Venkatasubbiah v. Venkata (1918) ILR 42 M 1. On the other side--apart from dicta in certain cases--there is Arunachalam Chetty v. Periasami Servai (1921) ILR 44 M 902 : 41 MLJ 256 (FB). In that case property had been attached before judgment, a decree had been passed and an order for sale had been granted in execution. The question the Court had to decide was whether the words "" property attached in execution of a decree "" in Article 11 of the Limitation Act covered an attachment before judgment. The Full Bench decided that they did. The main judgment was delivered by Wallis, C. J., with whom all the other Judges concurred. Spencer, J., delivered a separate judgment which--as I understand it--went no further than that of the Chief Justice. It must be conceded that the particular instance with which the Court was concerned was one in which sale had actually been ordered; but I cannot agree that fact affects the principle of the decision. An order for sale pre-supposes and is based on an existing attachment. It does not itself create the attachment. If therefore an attachment before judgment becomes at any stage an attachment in execution, it must, in my view, be at the stage where an application to execute has been made and admitted under Order 21, Rule 17. And that I conceive to be the principle laid down by the Full Bench. I may add that, in the present case, sale papers had been called for which is usually done after attachment has been ordered. I am unable to see how a subsequent order for sale would have altered the position. Wallis, C. J. explicitly stated that he was considering both cases, that is, those "" in which the claim ... is put in after decree or even, as in the present instance, after sale had been ordered in execution."" Further on he observed: ""This provision (Order 38, Rule 11) does not, in my opinion, enable us to say that property attached before judgment becomes property attached in execution of a decree upon the mere passing of a decree either within the meaning of Article 11 of the Limitation Act or of Order 21, Rule 57, as execution may never be applied for."" This sentence seems to me to indicate (a) that he was considering the meaning of the phrase under discussion both in Article 11 of the Limitation Act and in Order 21, Rule 57 (b) that he was of opinion nothing more was necessary to convert an attachment before judgment into an attachment in execution than an application to execute. The order for sale he regarded as "" proceeding on the footing that the property had to be considered as having been attached in execution by virtue of Rule 11."" The reference to Rule 11 requires an application to execute (and such an application would, but for the proviso in the rule itself, be for attachment as well as sale) is to my mind conclusive proof that he considered that the attachment changed its character from the time of the application to execute. And that was the view taken by Spencer, J. Wallis, C. J., no doubt remarked that Order 21, Rule 57, threw no light on the question he was considering. Nor did it. He was considering the meaning of a certain expression in Art 11 of the Limitation Act which was practically identical in terms with a phrase in Order 21, R.57, but found that the context-in which the latter stood gave him no assistance in interpreting the former.",
Article 11,"Kumarika Subarna Rekha Mani Devi And ... vs Ramakrishna Deo And Ors. on 1 December, 1966",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/12627/?formInput=Article%2011,,"In other words though under Article 11 an order rejecting the plaint is deemed to be a ""decree"" within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code and a decree so defined is specifically excluded from the definition of ""order"" in Section 2(14) C.P.C., did that Article deal with orders m generic term without regard to the above definitions in the C.P.C. It was held that Article 11 is not applicable as it certainly excluded orders of rejection of plaints from the purview of that Article. The Madras amendment, however, gave a different heading, viz.. memorandum of appeal when the appeal is from an order inclusive of an order determining any question under Section 47 or Section 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, which gave rise to a contention that this amendment did not adhere to the definition of ""order"" under Section 2(14) C.P.C. and had by re-defining it to include what was excluded under it, by its inclusion in the word ""decree"" as defined in Section 2(2). Even though the word ""decree"" or ""order"" has not been defined in the Central Court-fees Act, under Section 3 of the present Act these words unless the context otherwise requires are to have the same meaning as those given in the C.P.C. 



  "". . . . it is to be observed, that though those two are included in the word 'order' no doubt because they would be otherwise be excluded as being things to be reckoned amongst decrees and not amongst orders: an order rejecting a plaint, which is to be deemed to be a decree under the Code of Civil Procedure, is not included under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act."" 

 On a consideration it appears to me that ii ""order"" is used in its generic term to include all orders including those deemed to have been included within the definition of ""decree"" under Section 2(2) C. P. C. thrn there was no purpose in again including that in the word ""order"" as used either in Article 11 of Schedule  II of the Madras amend-ment or in Article 3 of Schedule  II of the present Act. If Articlp 3 Schedule  II of the Act taken as giving a new definition of the word ""order"", even then that does not specifically include orders under Order 7, Rule 11 C. P C. The conclusion is therefore inescapable hat orders under Order 7 Rule 11 C.PC. dealing with the rejection of plaints do not come within the purview of Article 11 of Schedule  II of the Central Act as amended by the Madras Act or under Article 3 Schedule  II of the present Act.  



 The learned Chief Justice after considering the definitions of 'order' and 'decree' under Section 2(14) and Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Code observed thus :-- 
  ""I think that the Court-fees Act, which Itself contains no definition of either the word 'order' or the word decree must have meant to follow the definition contained in the Code of Civil Procedure and I am strongly confirmed in this view by the words of Article 11 of Schedule  II which include in the word 'order' orders determining questions under Sections 47 and 144 of the Code of Civil Procedure. These are orders and it is quite unnecessary to say that the words 'memorandum of appeal when the appeal is from an order', are to include these orders if they would be included without their being specifically mentioned; and when one looks to find why it is that the Court-fees Acf has gone out of its way to say that 'order' in Article 11 of Schedule  II shall include two particular named orders, one finds the solution very ready to hand by looking at the definition of decree in the Civil Procedure Code because that definition deems as decrees not only orders rejecting plaints but also orders under sections 47 and 144, the very things referred to in Article 11 of Sch IT of the Court-fees Act: and it is to be observed, that though those two are included in the word order no doubt because they would otherwise be excluded as being things to be reckoned amongst decrees and not amongst orders, an order rejecting a plaint, which is to be deemed to be a decree under the Code of Civil Procedure is not included under Article 11 of Schedule II of the Court-fees Act."" 



 35. It must be remembered that nune of these cases approved of the contention that court fee in such cases was payable under Article 11, Schedule II of Act. 1870. All these indeed, were cases in which the Question of rejection of plaint on the grounds slated in Clauses (b) and (c) of Order VII. Rule 11 did arise and not on grounds in Clause (a) or (d) with which we are now concerned. The only case that dealt with this aspect, however, was . That was a case where the plaint in a suit to recover damages of Rs 10,000 for malicious prosecution had been rejected under Order VII Rule 11(a) C. P. C. The memorandum of appeal was filed with a court fee stamp of Rs 2 instead of Rs. 475 on Rs. 10,000 Relihance was placed on Schedule II, Article 11 of the Court-fees Act for the contention that the fixed court fee paid was sufficient. The learned Judges held that the order being under Section 2(2) of the Civil Procedure Codo which is deemed to be a decree it would not be covered by Schedule II, Article 11. Then reliance was placed on the Full Bench decision of the NaRpur High Court in AIR 1949 Nag 1 (FB) (Supra). Wanchoo C. J.. (as he then was) who delivered the opinion of the Court said that -",

     69.        It is also submitted by the Counsels that Clause 4 of the
     SHA, categorically states that the provisions of clause 11, 12, 14
     and Schedule 1 shall apply in relation to any transfer, or proposed
     transfer, of shares or any interest in shares and the said clauses of
     SHA being in consonance with the Articles, clearly overrides the
     alleged transfer Clause of MoU, rendering the MoU invalid and
     contrary to Articles and provisions of the Companies Act. In this



      regard, they state, alleged MoU was superseded by the valid and
     existing SHA and thereafter the terms of SHA were incorporated
     in Articles of 1996, Articles of 2012 and as on date, Articles of
     2014. It is also pointed out that even the respondent No.3 while
     seeking transfer of his shares in the joint name of petitioner and
     himself, sought the transfer in terms of Articles 11 (i) and 13 of
     the Company, whereas on respondent No.2's request, even after
     sharing all the requisite documents required and requested
     transfer of shares by respondent No. 2 in terms of Article 11 (i)
     and 13 of the Company, respondent No.3 initially tried to reject
     the transfer ostensibly on ground that 'the due process for shares
     has not been followed', whereas a joint transfer in his name and
     the petitioner was concluded by relying on the same Articles and
     later, on a repeated request by respondent No.2 vide email dated
     October 10, 2019 after sharing all the requisite documents,
     respondent No. 3 informed respondent No.2 that under the
     provisions of an undated MoU, the transfer was not permitted.",

Queoros And Ors. on 12 October, 1962",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1731487/?formInput=Article%2011,,"On the same date, i. e., the 21st December, 1959 the Stamp Reporter made a report to the effect that the court-fee on the said memorandum of appeal was payable not under Schedule II Article 11, but under Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. The amount of court-fee payable under Schedule II Article 17 (vii) of the Act, according to the Stamp Reporter, was Rs. 50/-, hence there was a deficiency of Rs. 45/- in the court-fee. On the 15th May, 1961, the appellant filed objections to this office report, and took up the position that the court-fee on the memorandum of appeal filed by her was payable under Schedule II Article 11, and not under Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. On this objection having been filed, a learned Judge of this Court passed an order on the 25th January, 1960, that the matter be put up before the Taxing Officer. 



 2. On behalf of the appellant, the learned counsel argued that the court-fee payable on a memorandum of appeal under Section 299 of the Indian Succession Act is governed by Schedule II Article 11, and not by Schedule II Article 17, Clause (vii) of the Act. According to Schedule II Article 11 of the Act a court-fee of Rs. 5/- is payable in Uttar Pradesh on a ""memorandum of appeal when the appeal is not from a decree, or an order having the force of a decree"" and is presented to the High Court. This provision of law would, therefore, be applicable only to a case where the appeal is not from a decree, or an order having the force of a decree! The question that arises for determination in the present case, therefore, is whether the order appealed against can be described as a decree or an order having the force of a decree. 



 If executability was to be the invariable quality of all decrees, one would expect that the Legislature would incorporate this feature in the provisions which define the nature, scope and contents of a decree. Further, if the Legislature wanted that Schedule II Article 11 should apply only to executable orders it could very easily have added the word ""executable"" before ""order"". 

 10. The view that an ""order having the force of a decree"" should be executable appears to be based on confusion between an order that has the force of a decree, and an order that is enforceable as a decree. Schedule II Article 11 of the Act clearly states that the order should have the force of a decree. It does not state that the order should be enforceable as a decree. The distinction between the two cases, though fine, is clear. 



 13. The learned Counsel for the appellant has also cited In re B. Venkataratnam, AIR 1941 Mad 639 in which it is held that Schedule II Article 11 applies to cases in which the statute provides that an order shall be subject to an appeal as if it were a decree. A perusal of the judgment of this case, however, shows that the learned Judges in that case based their view on the special amendment of Schedule II Article 11 as made in Madras. In any case, this decision nowhere goes to the length of laying down a negative proposition to the effect that unless there is an express provision in the statute that an order has the force of a decree, it cannot be regarded as such. If the intention of the Legislature was that only those orders are to have the force of decree in respect of which there is an express statutory provision to that effect, then one would expect that the statute should, instead of using the words ""order having the force of a decree"", have used the words ""order having the force of a decree under some statute"". The interpretation suggested, therefore, involves the addition of certain words not found in the provision of law in question, and is not warranted by the phraseology of Article 11 as it stands at present.",

Act"") for referring the matter to the Court for enhancement of the compensation. The learned District Judge, Raisen, made an award enhancing the amount of compensation at the rate of Rs. 20,000/ - per acre, to be paid to the respondent. The appellant, State of Madhya Pradesh, being dissatisfied by the enhanced award made by the Civil Court, has preferred the present appeal under Section 54 of the L.A. Act and ad valorem Court fees has been paid on the memorandum of appeal on its valuation. The claimant/respondent has also preferred cross-objection under Order 41, Rule 22 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for brevity ""the Code"") claiming further enhancement of compensation at the rate of Rs. 22,000/- per acre. The respondent has valued the cross-objection at Rs. 33,000/ - but has not paid ad valorem Court fees and has paid fixed Court fees as prescribed under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the Court Fees Act, 1870 (in brevity ""the C.F. Act""). A preliminary controversy surfaced before the referring Division Bench, whether fixed Court fees under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the C.F. Act is payable on the memorandum of appeal filed under Section 54 of the L.A. Act and the Cross-Objections in such appeals or ad valorem Court fees is payable under Article 1-A of Schedule 1 of the C.F. Act. On the strength of two Division Bench decisions of this Court rendered in First Appeal No. 15 of 1984 (Land Acquisition Officer, Seoni v. Laxminarain) decided on 7-8-1991 and reported in 1991 (2) MPJR 203, as well as First Appeal No. 35 of 1988 (Smt. Ganabai v. State of M.P.) decided on 24-4-1991 it was canvassed on behalf of the claimant/ respondent who was filed the cross-objection that only fixed Court fees under Article 11 of Schedule 2 of the Court Fees Act, 1870 is payable on the memorandum of appeal as well as on the cross-objection. 



 On the aforesaid conclusions their Lordships further took the view that the term ""decree"" used in Schedule 2, Article 11, is referable to decree as defined in Section 2(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure and as the decision of the Tribunal in the aforesaid case before the Supreme Court did not fulfil the requirements of a ""decree"" as mentioned above, the said decision of the Tribunal was not accepted as a decree within the meaing of Schedule 2, Article 11 of the C.F. Act and, therefore, it was held that the memorandum of appeal filed by the appellants squarely fell within the ambit of Schedule 2, Article 11 of the Court Fees Act and as such ad valorem Court fees under Schedule I Article 1, was not leviable.

 This Article 11 itself eloquently speaks about its applicability. It applies when the appeal is not from a decree or an order having the force of decree. As held by Supreme Court in Diwan Brothers Case (supra), in order to attract application of Article 11, the following conditions must be fulfilled.



 18. In the aforementioned context a reference of a decision of Calcutta High Court In Re Anunda Lal AIR 1932 Cal 346, may be also made with advantage, in which it was held as under at page 349 : 
  ""Section 8 standing in the text of the Act proceeds upon the assumption that otherwise in the Act there is a charge which is an ad valorem charge and is not fixed charge; and the only way in which it can be said that there is a charge has to be computed is that the charge is imposed by Article I, Schedule 1. The provision of Section 8 involving as they do that the fee in the class of cases dealt with is ad valorem fee are themselves sufficient to exclude any question of Article 11, Schedule 2, being made applicable to such cases. Section 8 shows one perfectly clearly that an appeal regarding compensation in a land acquisition cases is not under Article 11, Schedule 2, because it is not a fixed fee at all"".",
Article 11,"C.V. Venugopal Mudali vs C. Venkatasubbiah Chetty And Three Ors. on 2 February, 1915",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/625606/?formInput=Article%2011,,"2. The second defendant raised a preliminary contention that the suit was barred by limitation under Article 11 of the second schedule of the Limitation Act. His contentions were
  

(a) The order of the Division Bench dated December 1910 dismissing the appeal from the order dated August 1909 passed on the claim petition was passed without jurisdiction as no appeal lay against the latter order.

(b) Even if such an appeal lay the one year's period mentioned in the third column of the Article 11 of second schedule of the Limitation Act commenced in August 1909 (the date of the original order allowing the claim petition) and not from the date of the appellate order (December 1910).



(6-1) As the appellate order did not interfere with the original order it could not be held to have superseded the original order,
 

(6-2) As even if it superseded the original order the order mentioned in the third column of Article 11 means the original order the legislature not having in Article 11 used the words "" final decision or order ""(as the legislature did in Article 13) and not having expressly postponed the commencement of the limitation period to the date of the final order [as it did in Clause (2) of Article 182],
 




4. I might at once say that with very great deference I am unable to agree with the opinion of the learned Judge that the proper article applicable is not Article 11 of the Limitation Act but Article 13. The proceedings in an appeal against an order passed in a petition case are a continuation of the proceedings commenced by the petition and hence the appellate order is also an order on the same claim petition and as Article 11, Clause (1), specifically deals with a suit which is allowed to be brought by the legislature to contest the order on a claim, Article 13 cannot be applied. Their Lordships of the Privy Council have held that the suit itself so brought is in the nature of a review of the order passed in the claim petition and that it is a mistake to treat the action brought under Section 283, Civil Procedure Code, as an original action (see Phulkumari v. Ghanshyam Misra (1908) I.L.R. 35 Calc. 202 (P.C.) and Krishnappa Chetty v. Abdul Khader Saheb (1914) 26 M.L.J., 449 at p. 456.



9. It was however urged that because in two or three other articles of the Limitation Act special provision is made for counting the period from the date of the appellate order when there has been an appeal and no such special provisions are found in Article 11, therefore the legislature intended the date of the original order to be the starting point so far as the suits mentioned in Article 11 are concerned even when there has been a Letters Patent Appeal. It appears to ma that there are at least two answers to this argument. One answer is that the fact that the legislature in order to remove all doubts and with abundant caution has specially made provision in some cases for the contingency of an appeal, namely, that the order passed in the appeal was to be the starting point in those cases, that fact is not a sufficient reason for not construing the word ""order"" found in Article 11 as the only subsisting order passed on the claim petition (where there has been an appeal) in accordance with recognized principles of jurisprudence. Secondly, there seems to be at least one other article in the Limitation Act in which there is no express reference to the contingency of an appeal and to the decree passed on such an appeal, but the legislature must have intended that the starting point must be the date of the final appellate decree (in case there had been an appeal) and not the original decree. I refer to Article 175 which says that an application for payment of the decree amount by instalments under the Civil Procedure Code should be made within six months from the date of ""the decree."" Such an application is made under Order XX, Rule 11, Clause (2), and it cannot surely be held that where the Original Court passes a decree for a certain sum of money and the plaintiff appeals to the Appellate Court on the ground that he ought to have been decreed a larger sum but his appeal is dismissed an application under that order and rule cannot be made by the judgment-debtor after six months from the date of the original decree but within six months of the date of appellate decree even though the decree-holder consented to such an order being made.",
Article 11,"Nogendra Lal Chowdhury vs Fani Bhusan Das on 15 January, 1918",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1430218/?formInput=Article%2011,,"1. The only question to which we need address ourselves in this appeal is the question of limitation. In the course of certain execution proceedings the property now in dispute was attached. The present plaintiff preferred a claim to the property under Order XXI, Rule 58, Code of Civil Procedure. The claim was rejected and he brought this suit to establish his title to the property and for consequential reliefs. It is not disputed that if the order made in the execution proceedings rejecting the claim was an order within the scope of Order XXI, rule, 63, the present suit is a suit of the nature contemplated by that rule and is governed as to limitation by Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1908. The period of limitation prescribed in such a suit is one year from the date of the adverse order in the claim case. Here the suit was instituted more than a year after the claim was rejected. The defend-ant No. 1 pleaded, therefore, that the suit was out of time. The contention put forward on the plaintiff's behalf is that the claim having been rejected for default and without investigation, the order of rejection was not an order within Order XXI, Rule 63 and Article 11 had no application. The contention proved successful in the Courts below and the appeal before us has been preferred by this defendant No. 1. Now it may be useful to cite in this connection the language used by Lord Hobhouse in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council in the case of Sardhari Lal v. Ambika Pershad 15 I.A. 123 : 15 C. 521 : 5 Sar. P.C.J. 172 : 12 Ind. Jur. 210 : 7 Ind. Dec. (N.S.) 931. Lord Hobhouse said: ""The order"" that is, the order in the claim case to which he was referring, ""was made and it was an order within the jurisdiction of the Court that made it. It is not conclusive; a suit may be brought to claim the property, not with-standing the order; but then the law of limitation says that the plaintiff must be prompt in bringing his suit. The policy of the Act evidently is to secure the speedy settlement of question of title raised at execution sales and for that reason a year is fixed as the time within which the suit must be brought.""



2. If that was the policy of the law under the Civil Procedure Cede of 1877 and the Limitation Act of the same year, it is still more emphatically the policy of the law under the present Civil Procedure Code and the present Limitation Act.

3. On the plaintiff's behalf reliance has been placed on decisions of this Court under Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1877 but those decisions are no longer of authority because the language of Article 11 has been altered in the Act of 1903. The change made follows the change made in Section 283 of the Code of 1832 now represented by Rule 63 of Order XXI. Section 283 ran as follows: ""The party against whom an order under Section 280, 281 or 282 is passed may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute."" Rule 63 on the other hand says that where a claim or an objection is preferred, the party against whom an order is made may institute a suit to establish the right which he claims to the property in 'dispute. The specific reference to the previous sections or rules has been omitted. A corresponding change has been made in Article 11. The ground, therefore, on which the cases under the previous Limitation Act and the previous Code were decided, that the section specifically referred to in Article 11 and Section 283 of the Code required some investigation to be made, is gone. Rule 63 of the present Civil Procedure Code and Article 11 of the present Limitation Act are quite general in their terms. All that is now necessary is that a claim should be preferred under Rule 58 and that there should be an order either allowing or rejecting it. The party against whom the order is made may then bring a suit in the language of Rule 63 ""to establish the right which he claims to the property in dispute"" or in the language of Article 11 ""to establish the right which he claims to the property comprised in the order"", and the suit must be brought within the year allowed by Article 11.



5. The case of Umacharan Bhattacharjee v. Hironmoyee Debi 26 Ind. Cas. 943 : 18 C.W.N. 770 was decided in 1918, but the Article applied was Article 11 of the Limitation Act of 1877 and the case is of no assistance to the plaintiff. No doubt the learned Judges there held that Article 11 of the Act of 1877 was not applicable where there had been no investigation of the claim. But at the same time they referred to the change which had been made in the language of Article 11 by the Act of 1908 and remarked that the change might have altered the law.



6. The view we take is supported by the two decisions of the Madras High Court in Narasimha Chetti v. Vijiapala Nainar 27 Ind. Cas 944 : 2 L.W. 206 and Ponnusami Pillai v. Samu Ammal 38 Ind. Cas. 937 : 31 M.L.J. 247 in which the learned Judges pointed out that the language of Article 11 of the Act of 1908 was more comprehensive than the language of the preceding Act and refused to restrict the Article to those oases in which an investigation had taken place.

7. The result is that this appeal must be allowed and the whole suit dismissed with costs, both here and in the Courts below. But the dismissal of the suit will be without prejudice to any right which the plaintiff may have as against the defendant No. 2.",

     It is  also necessary  to add  that  merely  because  a
juristic entity	 may be an ""authority"" and therefore ""State""
within the  meaning of Article 12, it may not be elevated to
the position of ""State"" for the purpose of Articles 309, 310
and 311	 which find  a place  in Part XIV. The definition of
""State"" in  Article 12	which includes an ""authority"" within
the  territory	 of  India  or	under  the  control  of	 the
Government of  India is	 limited in  its application only to
Part III  and by  virtue of  Article 36, to Part IV: it does
not extend  to the  other provisions of the Constitution and
hence a juristic entity which may be ""State"" for the purpose
of Parts  III and IV would not be so for the purpose of Part
XIV or	any other provision of the Constitution. That is why
the decisions  of this	Court in S. L. Aggarwal v. Hindustan
Steel Ltd.  and other  cases involving	the applicability of
Article 311 have no relevance to the issue before us.



 The  learned   counsel  appearing	 on  behalf  of	 the
respondents Nos.  6 to	8, however,  relied strongly  on the
decision in  Sabhajit Tewary  v. Union of India & Ors(2) and
contended that this decision laid down in no uncertain terms
that a	society registered  under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860 can never be regarded as an ""authority"" within the
meaning of  Article 12.	 This being  a decision	 given by  a
Bench of  five Judges  of this	Court is undoubtedly binding
upon  us  but  we  do  not  think  it  lays  down  any	such
proposition as	is contended  on behalf	 of the respondents.
The question  which arose in this case was as to whether the
Council of  Scientific and  Industrial	Research  which	 was
juridically  a	 society  registered   under  the  Societies
Registration Act, 1860 was an ""authority"" within the meaning
of  Article 12.  The  test  which  the	 Court	applied	 for
determining this  question was the same as the one laid down
in the	International Airport  Authority's case and approved
by us, namely, whether the Council was an instrumentality or
agency of  the Government.  The Court implicitly assented to
the proposition	 that if  the Council  were an agency of the
Government, it	would undoubtedly  be an  ""authority"".	But,
having regard to the various

features enumerated in the judgment, the Court held that the
Council was  not an agency of the Government and hence could
not be	regarded as  an ""authority"".  The Court did not rest
its conclusion	on the ground that the Council was a society
registered under  the Societies	 Registration Act, 1860, but
proceeded to  consider various other features of the Council
for arriving  at the conclusion that it was not an agency of
the Government	and therefore not an ""authority"". This would
have been  totally unnecessary if the view of the Court were
that a	society registered  under the Societies Registration
Act can	 never be  an  ""authority""  within  the	 meaning  of
Article 12.



 The decision  in Sukhdev  Singh v.	 Bhagat Ram (1975) 3
SCR 619 was also strongly relied upon by the learned counsel
for respondents	 Nos. 6	 to 8  but we  fail to	see how this
decision  can	assist	the  respondents  in  repelling	 the
reasoning in  the International	 Airport Authority's case or
contending that	 a company or society formed under a statute
can  never   come  within  the	meaning	 of  the  expression
""authority"" in Article 12. That was a case relating to three
juristic bodies, namely, the Oil and Natural Gas Commission,
the Industrial	Finance Corporation  and the  Life Insurance
Corporation and	 the question  was whether they were ""State""
under Article 12. Each of these three juristic bodies was a
corporation created  by a  statute and the Court by majority
held that  they were  ""authorities""  and  therefore  ""State""
within the meaning of Article 12. The Court in this case was
not concerned with the question whether a company or society
formed under a statute can be an ""authority"" or not and this
decision does  not therefore  contain anything	which  might
even remotely  suggest that  such a  company or	 society can
never be  an ""authority"". On the contrary, the thrust of the
logic in  the decision,	 far from being restrictive, applies
to all juristic persons alike, irrespective whether they are
created by a statute or formed under a statute.



This was  again reiterated  by this  Court in  International
Airport Authority's case (supra) at page 1042 of the Report.
It must	 therefore now be taken to be well settled that what
Article 14  strikes at	is arbitrariness  because any action
that is	 arbitrary, must  necessarily  involve	negation  of
equality. The doctrine of classification which is evolved by
the courts  is not  para-phrase of  Article 14 nor is it the
objective and  end of  that Article. It is merely a judicial
formula for determining whether the legislative or executive
action in  question is	arbitrary and therefore constituting
denial of  equality. If the classification is not reasonable
and does  not satisfy  the two conditions referred to above,
the impugned  legislative or  executive action would plainly
be arbitrary  and the guarantee of equality under Article 14
would be breached. Wherever therefore there is arbitrariness
in State  action whether  it be of the legislature or of the
executive or  of ""authority""  under Article 12, Article  14
immediately springs  into action and strikes down such State
action. In  fact, the  concept of  reasonableness  and	non-
arbitrariness pervades	the entire constitutional scheme and
is a golden thread which runs though the whole of the fabric
of the Constitution.",

     There are	three aspects of Article 12 which require to
be particularly noticed. These aspects are
	  (i) the  definition given  in Article 12 is not an
	  explanatory  and  restrictive	 definition  but  an
	  extensive definition,
	  (ii) it  is the  definition of the expression ""the
	  State"" and  not of  the term	""State"" or ""States"",
	  and
	  (iii) it  is inserted	 in the Constitution for the
	  purposes of Parts III and IV thereof.
     As pointed	 out  in  Craies  on  Statute  Law,  Seventh
Edition, page  213, where an interpretation clause defines a
word  to   mean	 a   particular	 thing,	 the  definition  is
explanatory  and   facie  restrictive;	 and   whenever	  an
interpretation clause  defines a  term to include something,
the  definition	 is  extensive.	 While	an  explanatory	 and
restrictive definition	confines the  meaning  of  the	word
defined to  what is  stated in the interpretation clause, so
that wherever  the word	 defined is  used in  the particular
statute in  which that interpretation clause occurs, it will
bear only that meaning unless where, as is usually provided,
the subject  or context	 otherwise  requires,  an  extensive
definition expands  or	extends	 the  meaning  of  the	word
defined to  include within  it what would otherwise not have
been comprehended in it when the word defined is used in its
ordinary sense. Article 12 uses the

word  ""includes"".   It	thus  extends  the  meaning  of	 the
expression ""the	 State"" so as to include within it also what
otherwise may  not have been comprehended by that expression
when used in its ordinary legal sense.



 Article 12 defines the expression ""the State"" while the
other Articles	of the	Constitution referred to above, such
as Article 152 and Article 308, and clause (58) of section 3
of the	General Clauses	 Act defines  the term	""State"". The
deliberate use	of the	expression ""the State"" in Article 12
as also	 in Article  36 would  have normally shown that this
expression was	used to denote the State in its ordinary and
Constitutional sense  of an  independent or  sovereign State
and the	 inclusive clause  in Article 12 would have extended
this meaning  to include  within its scope whatever has been
expressly set  out in  Article 12.  The	 definition  of	 the
expression ""the	 State"" in  Article 12,	 is however, for the
purposes of  Parts III	and  IV	 of  the  Constitution.	 The
contents of these two Parts clearly show that the expression
""the State""  in Article 12 as	also in	 Article 36  is	 not
confined  to   its  ordinary  and  Constitutional  sense  as
extended by  the inclusive portion of Article 12 but is used
in the	concept of  the State in relation to the Fundamental
Rights guaranteed  by Part  III of  the Constitution and the
Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Part IV of
the Constitution which Principles are declared by Article 37
to be  fundamental to  the governance  of  the	country	 and
enjoins upon the State to apply in making laws.



     What is  the position  before us?	Is it  only one case
decided on a concession and another based upon an assumption
that a Government Company is ""the State"" under Article 12?
349
That is	 the position  in fact	but not	 in substance. As we
have seen,  authorities constituted  under, and corporations
established   by,    statutes	have   been   held   to	  be
instrumentalities and  agencies of  the Government in a long
catena of  decisions of	 this  Court.  The  observations  in
several of these decisions, which have been emphasised by us
in the passages extracted from the judgments in those cases,
are general  in their  nature and  take in  their sweep	 all
instrumentalities and agencies of the State, whatever be the
form which  such instrumentality or agency may have assumed.
Particularly   relevant	  in   this   connection   are	 the
observations of	 Mathew, J.,  in Sukhdev Singh and others v.
Bhagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi and another, of Bhagwati,
J., in	the International  Airport Authority's case and Ajay
Hasia's case  and of  Chinnappa Reddy,	J., in Uttar Pradesh
Warehousing   Corporations    case.   If    there   is	  an
instrumentality or agency of the state which has assumed the
garb of	 a Government  company as  defined in section 617 of
the Companies Act, it does not follow that it thereby ceases
to be  an instrumentality  or agency  of the  State. For the
purposes of  Article 12 one must necessarily see through the
corporate veil	to ascertain whether behind that veil is the
face of	 an instrumentality  or agency	of  the	 State.	 The
Corporation, which  is the  Appellant in  these two  Appeals
before us,  squarely falls  within these observations and it
also satisfies	the various tests which have been laid down.
Merely because	it has	so far	not the	 monopoly of  inland
water transportation  is not  sufficient to divest it of its
character of  an instrumentality  or agency of the State. It
is nothing  but the  Government operating behind a corporate
veil, carrying	out a governmental activity and governmental
functions of  vital public  importance. mere  can thus be no
doubt that the Corporation is ""the State"" within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution.",

drawn by the learned counsel for the contract labour from the
cases laying down the principles as to under what circumstances a
Government company or undertaking will fall within the meaning

We shall preface our  discussion of  those cases by indicating that
for purposes of enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed in
Part III of the Constitution the question whether  a Government
Company or undertaking is State within the meaning of Article
12 is germane. It is important to notice that in these cases the
pertinent question is appropriateness of the Government - which is
the appropriate Government within the meaning of CLRA Act;



whether, the Central or the State Government, is the appropriate
Government in regard to the industry carried on by the
Central/State Government Company or any undertaking and not
whether such Central/State Government company or undertaking
come within the meaning of Article 12.	The word State is
defined in Article 12  which is quoted in the footnote.
	In Sukhdev Singh & Ors. vs. Bhagatram Sardar Singh
Raghuvanshi & Anr.  , this Court, in the context whether service
Regulations framed by statutory corporations have the force of
law, by majority, held that the statutory corporations,	 like ONGC,
IFFCO, LIC established under different statutes fell under other
authorities and were, therefore, State within the meaning of
that term in Article 12 of the Constitution. The Court took into
consideration the following factors,  (a) they were owned,
managed and could also be dissolved by the Central Government;



In Ajay Hasia etc. Vs. Khalid Mujib Sehravardi & Ors.
etc.  ,	  the question	decided by a Constitution Bench of this
Court was: whether Jammu & Kashmir Regional Engineering
College, Srinagar, registered as a society under the Jammu &
Kashmir Registration of Societies Act, 1898, was State within
the meaning of	Article 12 of the Constitution so as to be
amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.  Having
examined the Memorandum of Association and the Rules of the
Society, the Court decided that the control of the State and the
Central Government was deep and pervasive and the society was a
mere projection of the State and the Central Government and it
was, therefore, an instrumentality or agency of the State and
Central Government and as such an authority-state within the
meaning of Article 12.



From the above discussion,  it follows that the fact of being
instrumentality of a Central/State Govt.  or  being State within
the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution  cannot be
determinative of the question as to whether an industry carried on
by a Company/Corporation or an instrumentality of the Govt. is
by or under the authority of the Central Government for the
purpose of or within the meaning of the definition of appropriate
Government in the CLRA Act. Take the case of a State
Government corporation/company/undertaking set up and owned
by the State Government which is an instrumentality or agency of
the State Government  and is engaged in carrying on an industry,
can it be assumed that the industry is carried on under the
authority of the Central Government, and in relation to any
industrial dispute concerning the industry can it be said that the
appropriate Government is the Central Government?  We think
the answer must be in the negative.  In the above  example if,	as a
fact,  any industry is carried on by the  State Government
undertaking under the authority of the Central Government, then
in relation to any industrial dispute concerning that industry, the
appropriate Government will be the Central Government.	This is
so not because it is agency or instrumentality of the Central
Government but because the industry is carried on by the State
Govt. Company/Corporation/Undertaking under the authority of
the Central Government.	 In our view, the same reasoning applies
to a Central Government undertaking as well.  Further, the
definition of establishment in CLRA Act takes in its fold purely
private undertakings which cannot be brought within the meaning
of Article 12 of the Constitution. In such a case how is
appropriate Government determined for the purposes of CLRA
Act or Industrial Disputes Act? In our view, the test which is
determinative is: whether the industry carried on by the
establishment in question is under the authority of the Central
Govt? Obviously, there cannot be one test for one part of
definition of establishment and another test for another part.
Thus, it is clear that the criterion is whether an
undertaking/instrumentality of Government is carrying on an
industry under the authority of the Central Government and not
whether the undertaking is instrumentality or agency of the
Government for purposes of Article 12 of the Constitution, be it of
Central Government or State Government.",
Article 12,"Sukhdev Singh & Ors vs Bagatram Sardar Singh Raghuvanshi And ... on 21 February, 1975",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/974148/?formInput=Article%2012,,"contemplated  in  Article 12  for  two	 principal  reasons.
First,	one  of the, attributes of a State is  making  laws.
The State exercises governmental functions and the executive
power  of  the State is co-extensive  with  the	 legislative
power  of the State.  Second, authority as  contemplated  in
Article 12 means a body of persons established	 by  statute
who  are  entitled  as such body to  command  obedience	 and
enforce	 directions  issued by them on pain of	penalty	 for
violation.   On these grounds it was said that these  corpo-
rations	 cannot	 make laws like a State and  cannot  enforce
directions.



This  Court in Rajasthan State Eeletricity Board, Jaipur  v.
Mohan & Ors. (1967) 3 S.C.A. 377) said that an ""authority is
a public administrative agency or corporation having  quasi-
governmental powers and authorised to administer a  revenue-
producing   public   enterprise. The	 expression   ""other
authorities""  in Article 12 has been held by this  Court  in
the  Rajasthan Electricity Board case to- be wide enough  to
include	 within it every authority created by a statute	 and
functioning  within  the territory of India,  or  under	 the
control of the Government of India.  This Court further said
referring  to earlier decisions that the  expression  ""Other
authorities""  in Article 12 will include all  constitutional
or  statutory  authorities on whom powers are  conferred  by
law.   The  State itself is envisaged under Article  298  as
having the right to carry on trade and. business.  The State
as

defined	 in  Article 12 is comprehended	 to  include  bodies
created	 for the purpose of promoting economic interests  of
the  people.   The circumstance that the statutory  body  is
required to carry on some activities of the nature of  trade
or  commerce  does  not	 indicate that	the  Board  must  be
excluded from the scope of the word ""State."" The Electricity
Supply	Act  showed  that  the	Board  had  power  to	give
directions,  the  disobedience of which is punishable  us  a
criminal  offence.   The power to issue	 directions  and  to
enforce compliance is an important aspect.
The  concurring Judgment in the Rajasthan Electricity  Board
case  said  that  the Board was	 invested  by  statute	with
extensive  powers of control over electricity  undertakings.
The power of the Board to make rules and regulations and  to
administer the Act was said to be in substance the sovereign
power of the State delegated to the Board.
In the British Boardcasting Corporation v. Johns  (Inspector
of Taxes) (1965) 1 Ch. 32) it was said that persons who	 are
created	 to carry out governmental purposes  enjoy  immunity
like  Crown  servants.	 Government  purposes  include	 the
traditional   provinces	 of  Government	 as  well  as	non-
traditional  provinces	of  Government	if  the	 Crown	 has
constitutionally  asserted  that they are to be	 within	 the
province   of	government.    The   British	Boardcasting
Corporation  was  held	not to be  within  the	province  of
government  because  broadcasting was not  asserted  by	 the
government  to	be within the province of  government.	 The
Wireless Telegraphy Act provided for regulation of  wireless
telegraphy  by	a system of licences.  The  Court  gave	 two
reasons	 as  to	 why the Broadcasting  Corporation  was	 not
within the province of the government.	If the	Broadcasting
Corporation  was exercising functions required	and  created
for the purpose of government. it is difficult to see why  a
licence	 was  required	to be issued to it.   Again,  it  is
difficult  to  understand why in the event of  an  emergency
powers	should be given to the Postmaster-General to  direct
that the broadcasting stations of the Corporation should  be
deemed to be in possession of Her Majesty if it be the	fact
that  such  stations  are  already  used  for  purposes	  of
exercising  functions required and created for	purposes  of
the Government.



The  Oil and Natural Gas Commission is owned by the  Govern-
ment.	It  is	a statutory body and  not  a  company.	 The
Commission   has  the  exclusive  privilege  of	  extracting
petroleum.  The management is by the Government.  It can  be
dissolved only by the Government.
The  Life Insurance Corporation is owned by  the  Government
The  life insurance business is nationalised and  vested  in
the  Corporation.   No	other  insurer	can  carry  on	life
insurance  business.  The management is by  the	 Government.
The dissolution can be only by the Government.
The  Industrial	 Finance Corporation is under  the  complete
control and management of the Central Government.   Citizens
cannot be shareholders.	 Certain specified institutions like
Scheduled Banks, Insurance Companies, Investment Trusts	 and
Co-operative  Banks may apply for the shares.	The  Central
Government  may	 acquire shares held by	 shareholders  other
than  the  Development Bank.  After  such  acquisition,	 the
Government  may	 direct that the entire undertaking  of	 the
Corporation  shall be vested in the Development	 Bank.	 The
Corporation cannot be dissolved except by the Government.
In the, background of the provisions of the three Acts under
consideration,	the  question  arises as  to  whether  these
corporations  can  be described to be authorities  with	 the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.  In the Rajasthan
Electricity  Board case it was said that the power  to	give
directions, the disobedience of which must be punishable  as
a  criminal  offence would furnish one of  the	reasons	 for
characterising	the body as an authority within the  meaning
of Article, 12.	 The power to make rules or regulations	 and
to  administer or enforce them would be one of the  elements
of  authorities	 contemplated in  Article 12.	 Authorities
envisaged  in Article 12 are described as  instrumentalities
of  State  action. on behalf of the State it  was  contended
that  the  Oil	and  Natural  Gas  Commission  as  well	  as
Industrial Finance Corporation was not granted immunity from
taxation  and  therefore  the liability to  be	taxed  would
indicate  that	the Corporation was not a  State  authority.
Reference  is made to Article 289 which speaks of  exemption
of property and income of a State from Union taxation.	 The
liability to taxation will not detract from the	 Corporation
being  an  authority  within  the  meaning  of	Article 12.
Article 289 empowers Union to impose tax in respect of trade
or business carried on by or on behalf of a State.
The  Oil  and Natural Gas Commission Act  confers  power  of
entry  on  employees  of the Commission	 upon  any  land  or
premises  for the purpose of lawfully carrying out works  by
the Commission.	 The mem-

In  Civil Appeal No. 115 of 1974, the judgment of  the	High
Court is set aside.  The Finance Corporation is an authority
within	the meaning of Article 12.  The regulations  of	 the
Corporation  have the force of law.  The conclusion  of	 the
High  Court that the Association is not entitled to raise  a
plea  of  discrimination on the basis of Article 16  is	 set
aside.
The appeals are disposed of accordingly.
The  parties will pay and bear their own costs in all  these
appeals.
MATHEW, J.-The question whether a public corporation of	 the

of far reaching im  portance.",
Article 12,"K.Marappan vs The Deputy Registrar Of Co-Operative ... on 29 September, 2006",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/186075/?formInput=Article%2012,,"It is clear from the above conclusion that the five-Judge Bench approved the earlier decisions of two Full Benches that no writ petition is maintainable as against a co-operative society. The five-Judge Bench has held that the same needs no reconsideration and reiterated that no writ will lie against a co-operative society.

	4.  In the referring order Katju, C.J. (as he then was) speaking for the Bench has observed that there can be two kinds of co-operative societies - one which can be regarded as an instrumentality of the State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, and the other which is not an instrumentality of the State within the scope of Article 12 of the Constitution. While a writ will lie against a co-operative society falling under the first category, no writ will lie against a co-operative society, which falls under the second category. Whether a co-operative society is an instrumentality of the State under Article 12 of the Constitution or not will depend upon the various tests laid down by the Supreme Court in various decisions, e.g whether there is deep and pervasive control of the Government, extent of the shareholding of the Government, etc. It cannot be laid down as a universal proposition, that no writ can ever lie against a co-operative society.  It will depend on the nature of the society and various other factors. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the seven-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas v. Indian Institute of Chemical Technology, (2002) 5 SCC 111 and certain other Supreme Court decisions.



In paragraph 12 it has been held that no writ would issue where dismissal was not in violation of any statutory provision. No reinstatement could be ordered. 

	13. In Federal Bank Limited Vs. Sagar Thomas, (2003) 10 SCC 733, the Supreme Court explained and distinguished the decision in Anadi Muktas case (cited supra). In that case, the 1st respondent who was working as a Branch Manager in the appellant Bank was chargesheeted and ultimately awarded punishment of dismissal. The 1st respondent challenged his dismissal by filing a writ petition before the High Court. A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the writ petition was taken by the appellant Bank saying that it is a private bank and not a State or its agency or instrumentality within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution, hence, a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable against it. The learned single Judge, however, found that the Federal Bank performs a public duty, and as such it comes under the definition of other authority within the meaning of Article 12, and as such the writ petition was maintainable. Aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment of the learned single Judge, the appellant preferred a writ appeal. The said writ appeal was dismissed providing that the learned single Judge shall decide the writ petition on merits. The question which fell for consideration before the Supreme Court on appeal was as to whether the appellant Bank is a private body or falls within the definition of the State or local or other authorities under the control of the Government within the meaning of Article 12. Allowing the appeal, the Court held that a private company carrying on banking business as a Scheduled Bank, cannot be termed as an institution or a company carrying on any statutory or public duty. Mere regulatory provisions to ensure that commercial activity carried on by private bodies work within a discipline, neither confer any status upon the company nor put any obligation upon it which may be enforced through issuance of a writ under Article 226. It was merely a case of disciplinary action being taken against its employee by the appellant Bank. The respondent was not trying to enforce any statutory duty on the part of the Bank. The termination of service, therefore, cannot be challenged by the respondent by filing a writ petition under Article 226. The decision in Anadi Muktas case was distinguished as in that case the writ petition was held to be maintainable, since the teacher whose services were terminated by the institution was affiliated to the university and was governed by the ordinances, casting certain obligations which it owed to the petitioner. The Court also elaborately discussed the six factors which have been enumerated in the case of Ajay Hasia and held that such private companies would normally not be amenable to the writ jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. But in certain circumstances a writ may issue to such private bodies or persons, as there may be statutory provisions which need to be complied with by all concerned, including the private companies. For example, there are certain legislations like the Industrial Disputes Act, the Minimum Wages Act, the Factories Act or for maintaining proper environment, say the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 or the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, etc., or statutes of the like nature which fasten certain duties and responsibilities statutorily upon such private bodies which they are bound to comply with. If they violate such statutory provisions a writ may certainly be issued for compliance with those provisions. For instance, if a private employer dispenses with the services of its employee in violation of the provisions contained under the Industrial Disputes Act, in innumerable cases the High Court interfered and has issued writ to the private bodies and the companies in that regard. But, the difficulty in issuing a writ may arise where there may not be any non-compliance with or violation of any statutory provision by the private body. In that event, the writ may not be issued at all. Other remedies as may be available, may have to be resorted to. 



Thus, the question as to whether the co-operative Society is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution was expressly kept open. 

 16. Learned counsel for the appellant also drew our attention to the decision of the Full Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Sri Konaseema Co-op. Central Bank Limited Vs. N.Seetharama Raju, AIR 1990 AP 171. The question before the Full Bench was whether a Co-operative Central Bank registered under the A.P. Co-operative Societies Act is a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. The Bench held that the control vested in the Government and the Registrar, particularly, the power to divide, amalgamate or merge the societies, power to conduct elections to the Committee (disabling the society to conduct such election itself), power to supersede the Committee, power to recover amounts due to the society as arrears of land-revenue, power to provide common cadres for the employees of several independent societies, as also the extensive power to give binding directions vested in both the Government and the Registrar, not only in the interest of shareholders, depositors and creditors, but also in the interest of the public and of co-operative movement, is liable to be characterised as deep and pervasive control, within the meaning of the 4th test in Ajay Hasias case. The Bench, however, noted that the appellant Banks main object was to raise funds to finance its members and functions of Bank were not of public importance and closely related to governmental functions, and therefore, it cannot be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12. The Bench held that if in a given case a particular co-operative society can be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution (applying the tests evolved by the Supreme Court in that behalf) it would also be an authority within the meaning, and for the purpose of Article 226 of the Constitution. In such a situation, an order passed by a society against its employee in violation of the bye-laws can be corrected by way of a writ petition. This is not because the bye-laws have the force of law, but on the ground that having framed the bye-laws prescribing the service conditions of its employees the society has to follow them in the interest of fairness. If it is left to the sweet will and pleasure of the society either to follow or not to follow bye-laws, it would be inherently arbitrary and may very likely give rise to discriminatory treatment. A society which is a State, has to act in conformity with Article 14 of the Constitution and for that reason it would be made to follow bye-laws. The Bench also held that the bye-laws made by a so-operative society do not have the force of law, and hence, where a society cannot be characterized as a State the service conditions of its employees governed by bye-laws cannot be enforced through a writ petition. The Bench further held that even if a society cannot be characterised as a State within the meaning of Article 12, even so a writ would lie against it to enforce a statutory public duty which an employee is entitled to enforce against a society. In such a case, it is unnecessary to go into the question whether the society is being treated as a person or an authority within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. What is material is the nature of the statutory duty placed upon it and the Court will enforce such statutory duty.



 19. Learned Advocate General also placed reliance on the decision in G.Bassi Reddy Vs. International Crops Research Institute, (2003) 4 SCC 225. The question involved in that case was whether a writ petition would lie against ICRISAT which was set up as a non-profitable research and training centre by the Consultative Group of International Agricultural Research is a State or other authority within the meaning of Article 12. Applying the test in Pradeep Kumar Biswas Case, it was held that ICRISAT is not a State  or other authority as defined in Article 12 of the Constitution. The following observations of the Bench is pertinent to note:- (SCC p.237)
	Para - 27: It is true that a writ under Article 226 also lies against a person for any other purpose. The power of the High Court to issue such a writ to any person can only mean the power to issue such a writ to any person to whom, according to the well-established principles, a writ lay. That a writ may issue to an appropriate person for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III is clear enough from the language used. But the words and for any other purpose must mean for any other purpose for which any of the writs mentioned would, according to well-established principles issue.",
Article 12,"Zee Telefilms Ltd. & Anr vs Union Of India & Ors on 2 February, 2005",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/404603/?formInput=Article%2012,,"A perusal  of the above Article  shows that the definition  of State in 
the said Article includes the Government of India, Parliament of India, 
Government of the State,  Legislatures of the States, local authorities as also 
""other authorities"".  It is the argument of the Board that it does not come 
under the term ""other authorities"", hence is not a State for the purpose of 
Article 12.  While the petitioner contends to the contrary on the ground that 
the various activities of the Board  are in the nature of public duties.  A 
literal reading of the definition of State under Article 12 would not  bring the 
Board under the term ""other authorities""  for the purpose of Article 12.  
However, the process of judicial interpretation has expanded  the scope of  
the term ""other authorities"" in its various judgments.  It is on this basis that 
the petitioners contend that the Board would come under  the expanded  
meaning of the term ""other authorities""   in Article 12 because of its 
activities which is that of a public body discharging public function.  



Assuming that these facts are correct the question then is, would it 
be sufficient to hold the Board to be a State for the purpose of Article 12?

There is no doubt that Article 19(1)(g) guarantees to all citizens the 
fundamental right to practise any profession or to carry on any trade 
occupation or business and that such a right can only be regulated by the 
State by virtue of Article 19(6). Hence, it follows as a logical corollary 
that any violation of this right will have to be claimed only against the 
State and unlike the rights under Articles 17 or 21 which can be claimed 
against non state actors including individuals the right under Article 
19(1)(g) cannot be claimed against an individual or a non State entity. 
Thus, to argue that every entity, which validly or invalidly arrogates to 
itself the right to regulate or for that matter even starts regulating the 
fundamental right of the citizen under Article 19(1)(g), is a State within 
the meaning of Article 12 is to put the cart before the horse. If such logic 
were to be applied every employer who regulates the manner in which his 
employee works would also have to be treated as State. The pre-requisite 
for invoking  the enforcement of a fundamental right under Article 32 is 
that the violator  of that right should be a State first.  Therefore, if the 
argument of the learned counsel  for the petitioner is to be accepted then 
the petitioner will have to first establish that the Board is a State under 
Article 12 and it is violating  the fundamental rights of the petitioner. 
Unless this is done  the petitioner cannot allege that the Board violates 
fundamental rights and is therefore State within Article 12.  In this 
petition under Article 32 we have already held  that the petitioner has 
failed to establish that the Board is State within the meaning of Article 12. 
Therefore assuming there is violation of any fundamental right by the 
Board that will not make the Board a ""State"" for the purpose of Article 12.



Thus, it is clear that when a private body exercises its public 
functions  even if it is not a State, the aggrieved person has a remedy not 
only under the ordinary law but also under the Constitution, by way of a 
writ petition under Article 226.  Therefore, merely because a non-
governmental body exercises some public duty that by itself would not 
suffice to make such body a State for the purpose of Article 12. In the 
instant case the activities of the Board do not come under the guidelines 
laid down by this Court in Pradeep Kumar Biswas case (supra), hence 
there is force in the contention of Mr. Venugopal that this petition under 
Article 32 of the Constitution is not maintainable.
At this stage, it is relevant to note another contention of               
Mr. Venugopal that the effect of treating the Board as State will have far 
reaching consequences in as much as nearly 64 other national sports 
federations as well as some other bodies which represent India in the 
international forum in the field of art, culture, beauty pageants, cultural 
activities, music and dance, science and technology or other such 
competitions will also have to be treated as a ""State"" within the meaning 
of Article 12, opening the flood gates of litigation under Article 32.   We 
do find sufficient force in this argument. Many of the above mentioned 
federations or bodies do discharge functions and/ or exercise powers 
which if not identical are at least similar to the functions discharged by 
the Board.  Many of the sport persons and others who represent their 
respective bodies make a livelihood out of it (for e.g. football, tennis, 
golf, beauty pageants etc.). Therefore, if the Board which controls the 
game of Cricket is to be held to be a State for the purpose of Article 12, 
there is absolutely no reason why other similarly placed bodies should 
not be treated as State.  The fact that game of Cricket is very popular in 
India also cannot be a ground to differentiate these bodies from the 
Board. Any such differentiation dependent upon popularity, finances and 
public opinion of the body concerned would definitely violate Article 14 
of the Constitution, as any discrimination to be valid must be based on 
hard facts and not mere surmises (See State of Kerala v. T.P. Roshana, 
(1979) 1 SCC 572) Therefore, the Board in this case cannot be singly 
identified as ""other authority"" for the purpose of Article 12. In our 
opinion, for the reasons stated above none of the other federations or 
bodies referred to hereinabove including the Board can be considered as a 
""State"" for the purpose of Article 12.



used in Article 12 therefore remain, to use the words of 
Cardozo (Benjamin Cardozo : The Nature of the Judicial 
Process), among ""the great generalities of the 
Constitution"" the content of which has been and 
continues to be supplied by courts from time to time.""

Officer, Central Section, Assessment Wing, Calcutta and Others  (1998) 1 
SCC 458] 	
	What is necessary is to notice the functions of the Body concerned.  A  
`State' has different meanings in different context.  In a traditional sense, it 
can be a body politic but in modern international practice, a State is an 
organization which receives the general recognition accorded to it by the 
existing group of other States.  Union of India recognizes the Board as its 
representative.  The expression ""other  authorities"" in Article 12 of the 
Constitution of India is 'State' within the territory of India as 
contradistinguished from a State within the control of the Government of 
India.  The concept of State under Article 12 is in relation to the fundamental 
rights guaranteed by Part-III of the Constitution and Directive Principles of 
the State Policy contained in Part-IV thereof.  The contents of these two 
parts manifest that Article 12 is not confined to its ordinary or constitutional  
sense of an independent or sovereign meaning so as to include within its fold 
whatever comes within the purview thereof so as to instill the public 
confidence in it.",
Article 12,"Thalappalam Ser.Coop.Bank Ltd.& Ors vs State Of Kerala & Ors on 7 October, 2013",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/37517217/?formInput=Article%2012,,"4.    Mr. K. Padmanabhan Nair, learned senior counsel appearing for some  of
the societies submitted that the views expressed by the  Division  Bench  in
Thalapalam Service Co-operative Bank  Ltd.  (supra)  is  the  correct  view,
which calls for our approval.  Learned senior counsel took  us  through  the
various provisions of the Societies Act as  well  as  of  the  RTI  Act  and
submitted that the societies are autonomous bodies and  merely  because  the
officers functioning under the Societies Act have  got  supervisory  control
over the societies will not make the  societies  public  authorities  within
the meaning of Section 2(h) of the RTI Act.   Learned  senior  counsel  also
submitted that these societies are not owned,  controlled  or  substantially
financed, directly or indirectly, by the State Government.   Learned  senior
counsel also submitted that the societies are not statutory bodies  and  are
not performing any public functions and will not come within the  expression
“state” within the meaning under Article 12 of the Constitution of India.



12.    We  are  in  these  appeals  concerned  only  with  the  co-operative
societies registered or deemed  to  be  registered  under  the  Co-operative
Societies Act, which are not owned, controlled or substantially financed  by
the State or Central Government or formed,  established  or  constituted  by
law made by Parliament or State Legislature.

Co-operative Societies and Article 12 of the Constitution:

13.   We may first examine, whether the Co-operative Societies,  with  which
we are concerned,  will  fall  within  the  expression  “State”  within  the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution of India  and,  hence  subject  to
all  constitutional  limitations  as  enshrined   in   Part   III   of   the
Constitution.  This Court in U.P. State Co-operative Land  Development  Bank
Limited v. Chandra Bhan Dubey and others (1999) 1  SCC  741,  while  dealing
with the question of the maintainability of the writ  petition  against  the
U.P. State Co-operative  Development  Bank  Limited  held  the  same  as  an
instrumentality of the State and an authority mentioned  in  Article 12  of
the Constitution.   On facts, the Court noticed  that  the  control  of  the
State Government on the Bank is all pervasive and that the  affairs  of  the
Bank are controlled by the State Government though it is  functioning  as  a
co-operative society, it is an  extended  arm  of  the  State  and  thus  an
instrumentality of the State or authority as mentioned under Article 12  of
the Constitution. In All India Sainik Schools  employees’  Association  v.
Defence Minister-cum-Chairman Board of Governors,  Sainik  Schools  Society,
New Delhi and others (1989) Supplement 1  SCC 205, this Court held that  the
Sainik School society is “State” within the meaning of  Article 12  of  the
Constitution after having found that the entire  funding  is  by  the  State
Government and by the Central Government and the overall  control  vests  in
the governmental authority and the main object of  the  society  is  to  run
schools and prepare students for the purpose feeding  the  National  Defence
Academy.



18.   We have, on facts, found that the Co-operative Societies,  with  which
we are concerned in these appeals,  will  not  fall  within  the  expression
“State” or “instrumentalities of the State” within the  meaning  of  Article
12  of  the  Constitution  and  hence  not  subject  to  all  constitutional
limitations as enshrined in Part III of the Constitution.  We may,  however,
come across situations where a body or organization though not  a  State  or
instrumentality of the State, may still satisfy  the  definition  of  public
authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Act, an aspect which  we
may discuss in the later part of this Judgment.



(a) Body owned  by  the  appropriate  government  –  A  body  owned  by  the
appropriate government clearly falls under Section 2(h)(d)(i)  of  the  Act.
A body owned, means to have a good legal title to  it  having  the  ultimate
control over the affairs of that body, ownership takes in its fold  control,
finance etc.   Further discussion of this concept  is  unnecessary  because,
admittedly, the societies in question  are  not  owned  by  the  appropriate
government.

(b)   Body Controlled by the Appropriate Government

      A body which is controlled by  the  appropriate  government  can  fall
under the definition of public authority under  Section  2h(d)(i).   Let  us
examine the meaning of the expression “controlled” in  the  context  of  RTI
Act and not  in  the  context  of  the  expression  “controlled”  judicially
interpreted while examining  the  scope  of  the  expression  “State”  under
Article 12 of the Constitution or in the context  of  maintainability  of  a
writ against a body or authority under Article 226 of  the  Constitution  of
India.       The word “control” or “controlled” has not been defined in  the
RTI Act, and hence, we have  to  understand  the  scope  of  the  expression
‘controlled’ in the context of the words which exist  prior  and  subsequent
i.e. “body owned” and “substantially financed”  respectively.   The  meaning
of the word “control” has come up for consideration in several cases  before
this Court in different contexts.  In State of West Bengal  and  another  v.
Nripendra Nath Bagchi, AIR 1966 SC  447  while  interpreting  the  scope  of

Court over  District  Courts,  this  Court  held  that  the  word  “control”

Article 13,"Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru ... vs State Of Kerala And Anr on 24 April, 1973",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/257876/?formInput=Article%2013,,"Although ""law"" must ordinarily include Constitutional law there is a clear 
demarcation between ordinary law which is made in the exercise of 
legislative power and Constitutional law, which is made in the exercise of 
constituent power. In the context of Article 13, ""law"" must be taken to 
mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power 
and not amendments to the Constitution made in the exercise of 
constituent power with the result that Article 13(2) does not affect 
amendments made under Article 368.



29. He observed as follows:
It is true that there is no complete definition of the word ""law""' in the 
article but it is significant that the definition does not seek to exclude 
Constitutional amendments which it would have been easy to indicate in 
the definition by adding ""but shall not include an amendment of the 
Constitution"".
30. He further observed:
The meaning of Article 13 thus depends on the sense in which the word 
""law"" in Article 13(2) is to be understood. If an amendment can be said to 
fall within the term ""law"", the Fundamental Rights become ""eternal and 
inviolate"" to borrow the language of the Japanese Constitution. Article 13 
is then on par with Article 5 of the American Federal Constitution in its 
immutable prohibition as long as it stands.



(6) As the Constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act 
holds the field, the validity of the two impugned Acts, 
namely, the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act X of 
1953, and the Mysore Land Reforms Act X of 1962, as 
amended by Act XIV of 1965, cannot be questioned on the 
ground that they offend Articles 13, 14 or 31 of the 
Constitution.
42. It must be borne in mind that these conclusions were given in the light of the 
Constitution as it stood then i.e. while Article 13(2) subsisted in the Constitution. It was 
then not necessary to decide the ambit of Article 368 with respect to the powers of 
Parliament to amend Article 13(2) or to amend Article 368 itself. It is these points that 
have now to be decided.



(3) Article 368 is not controlled by Article 13(2) and the prohibitory 
injunction in Article 13(2) is not attracted against the amending power; 
(4) Constitutional amendment under Article 368 is not a law within the 
meaning of Article 13(2);
(5) The scale of value embodied in Parts III and IV is not immortal. Parts 
III and IV being parts of the Constitution are not immune from 
amendment under Article 368. Constition-makers could not have intended 
that the rights conferred by Part III could not be altered by giving effect to 
the policies of Part IV.",

	In our view,   this thinking of the High Court is erroneous. 
The only restriction on the power of the CBDT is to prevent it 
from interfering  with the course of assessment of any particular 
assessee or the discretion of the Commissioner of Income-Tax 
(Appeals). It would be useful to recall the background against 
which this circular was issued. 

The Income-tax authorities were seeking to examine  as to 
whether the assessees were actually residents of a third country on 
the basis of alleged control of management therefrom.  
We have already extracted the relevant provisions of Article 
4 which provide that, for the purposes of the agreement, the term 
'resident of a contracting State' means any person who under the 
laws of that State is liable to taxation therein by reason of his 
domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of 
similar nature.  The term 'resident of India' and 'the resident of 
Mauritius' are to be construed accordingly.  Article 13 of the 
DTAC lays down detailed rules with regard to taxation of capital 
gains. As far as capital gains resulting from alienation of shares are 
concerned, Article 13(4) provides  that the gains derived by a 
'resident' of a contracting State  shall be taxable only in that State. 
In the instant case, such capital gains derived by a resident of 
Mauritius shall be taxable only in Mauritius.  Article 4, which we 
have already referred to, declares that the term resident of 
Mauritius' means any person who under the laws of Mauritius is 
'liable to taxation' therein by reason, inter alia, of his residence. 
Clause (2) of Article 4 enumerates detailed rules as to how the 
residential status of an individual resident in both contracting 
States has to be determined for the purposes of DTAC.  Clause(3) 
of Article 4 provides that if, after application of the detailed rules 
provided in Article 4, it is found that a person other than an 
individual is a resident of both the contracting States, then it shall 
be deemed to be a resident of the contracting State  in which its 
place of effective management is situated.  The DTAC requires the 
test of 'place of effective management' to be applied only for the 
purposes of the tie-breaker  clause in Article 4(3) which could be 
applied only when it is found that a person other than an individual 
is a resident both of  India  and Mauritius.  We see no purpose or 
justification in the DTAC for application of this test in any other 
situation.  



	Some of the assumptions underlying this contention, which 
prevailed with the High Court, need greater critical appraisal.
	Article 13(4) of the DTAC  provides that gains derived by a 
resident of a Contracting State from alienation of any property, 
other than those specified in the paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the 
Article, shall be taxable only in that State. Since most of the 
arguments centred around capital gains made on transactions in 
shares on the stock exchange in India, we may leave out of 
consideration capital gains on the type of properties contemplated 
in paras 1, 2 and 3 of Article 13 of the DTAC. The residuary clause 
in para 4 of Article 13 is relevant.  It provides that capital gains 
made on sale of shares shall be taxable only in the State of which 
the person is a 'resident' taking us back to the meaning of the term 
'resident' of a contracting State.  According to Article 4, this 
expression means any person who under the laws of that State is 
""liable to taxation"" therein by reason of his domicile, residence, 
place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature.  
The terms 'resident of India' and 'resident of Mauritius' are 
required to be construed accordingly.  This takes us to the test to 
determine when a company is 'liable to taxation' in Mauritius. 



It is, therefore, not possible for us to accept the contentions 
so strenuously urged  on behalf of the respondents that avoidance 
of double taxation can arise only when tax is actually paid in one 
of the Contracting States.
The decision of Federal Court of Australia in Commissioner 
of Taxation v. Lamesa Holdings  is illuminating.  The issue before 
the Federal Court was whether a Netherlands company was liable 
to income-tax under the Australian Income Tax Act on profits from 
the sale of shares in an Australian company and whether such 
profits fell within Article 13 (alienation of property) of the 
Netherlands-Australia Double Taxation Agreement, so as to be 
excluded from Article 7 (business profits) of that Agreement.  One  
Leonard Green, a principal of Leonard Green and Associates a 
limited partnership established in the United States, became aware 
of a potential investment opportunity in Australia. Arimco 
Resources and Mining Company NL ('Armico'), a company listed 
on the Australian Stock Exchange, which had a subsidiary  called 
Armico Mining Pty. Limited engaged in gold mining activities, 
was the subject of a hostile takeover bid, at a price which Green 
was advised  was less than the real value of the Armico. With this 
knowledge Green decided to mount a takeover offer for the 
subsidiary company. Then followed a series of steps of formation 
of a number of companies with interlocking share holdings where 
each company owned 1005 shares of a different subsidiary 
company.  Lamesa Holdings  was one such intermediary company 
of which 100% shares were held by Green Equity Investments Ltd.  
The share transactions brought about a profit to Lamesa Holdings 
which would be assessable to tax under the Australian Income Tax 
Act. Lamesa, however, relied on the provisions of the Article 13(2) 
of the Double Taxable Avoidance Convention ('DTAC') between 
Netherlands and Australia and claimed that the income was not 
taxable in Australia by reason thereof.  This income was wholly 
exempt from tax in Netherlands by  reason of the Income Tax Law 
applicable therein. The Federal Court found that  under Article
13(2) (a) (ii) of the DTAC shares in a company were treated as 
personalty, that since the place of incorporation of a company or 
the place of situs of a share may be the subject of choice,  the place 
of incorporation or the register upon which shares were registered 
would not form a particularly close connection with shares to 
ground the jurisdiction to tax share profits.  It was held:",

retrospective effect.  The majority however held that  after
the  coming  into force of the Constitution  the  effect  of
article 13(1) on such repugnant laws was that it  nullified
them,  and made them ineffectual and nugatory and devoid  of
any  legal force or binding effect.  It was further  pointed
out in one of the judgments representing the majority  view,
that the American rule that if a statute is repugnant to the
Constitution  the  statute is void from its  birth,  has  no
application  to	 cases concerning  obligations	incurred  or
rights	accrued in accordance with an existing law that	 was
constitutional	in  its inception, but that if any  law	 was
made  after the 26th January, 1950, which was  repugnant  to
the  Constitution,  then  the same rule	 shall	have  to  be
followed  in  India  as followed  in  America.	 The  result
therefore  of  this pronouncement is that the  part  of	 the
section of an existing law which is unconstitutional is	 not
law,  and is null and void.  For determining the rights	 and
obligations  of	 citizens the part declared void  should  be
notionally taken to be obliterated from the section for	 all
intents	 and purposes, though it may remain- written on	 the
statute	 book and be a good law when a question	 arises	 for
determination  of rights and obligations incurred  prior  to
26th January, 1950, and also for the determination of rights
of persons who have not been given fundamental rights by the
Constitution.	Thus, in this situation, there is  no  scope
for  introducing  terms like "" relatively void ""  coined  by
American  Judges in construing a Constitution which  is	 not
drawn  up in similar language and the implications of  which
are not quite familiar in this country."" The learned  Judge,
as  we	have already pointed out, rejected  the	 distinction
made  by Venkatarama Aiyar, J., between lack of	 legislative
power and the abridgment of the fundamental rights.   Though
that  question	did not directly arise,	 the  learned  Judge
expressed  his view on the scope of Art. 13(2) at  page	 653
thus:



""  The authority thus conferred by Articles 245 and  246  to
make  laws  subjectwise	 in the	 different  Legislatures  is
qualified by the declaration made in


article 13(2).	That power can only be exercised subject  to
the   prohibition  contained  in  article 13(2).   On	 the
construction  of  article 13(2) there was no  divergence  of
opinion	 between the majority and the minority	 in  Keshava
Madhava	 Menon v. The State of Bombay (supra).	It was	only
on  the	 construction of article 13(1) that  the  difference
arose  because	it  was felt that  that	 article  could	 not
retrospectively	  invalidate  laws  which  when	 made	were
constitutional according to the Constitution then in force.""



"" ..................... on and after the commencement of the
Constitution  the existing law, as a result of its  becoming
inconsistent  with the provisions of article  19(1)(g)	read
with clause (6) as it then stood, could not be permitted  to
stand in the way of the exercise of that fundamental  right.
Article 13(1) by reason of its language cannot be  read  as
having obliterated the entire operation of the	inconsistent
law  or	 having	 wiped it out altogether  from	the  statute
book ............... In short, article 13(1) had the  effect

Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet of 
Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, ""



33.		In the earlier decision in Indra Sawhney Vs. Union of India 
[1992 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 454), B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the 
majority, while acknowledging that equality and equal opportunity is a basic 
feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant  position of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India in the scheme of things.  His Lordship 
stated:-

""6. The significance attached by the founding fathers to 
the right to equality is evident not only from the fact that 
they employed both the expressions 'equality before the 
law' and 'equal protection of the laws' in Article 14 but 
proceeded further to state the same rule in positive and 
affirmative terms in Articles 15 to 
18






Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment 
is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of 
our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the 
need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of 
the Constitution.  Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public 
employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold 
that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a 
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any 
right on the appointee.  If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment 
comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement or 
appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end 
when it is discontinued.  Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to 
be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment.  It has also to 
be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage 
worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would 
not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely 
on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not 
made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant 
rules.  It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the 
instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to 
an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, 
do not acquire any right.  High Courts acting under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, 
regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was 
made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.  Merely because, 
an employee had continued under cover of an order of Court, which we have 
described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of the judgment, he 
would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the 
service.  In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing 
interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it 
is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such 
a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an 
interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular 
procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an 
employee who is really not required.  The courts must be careful in ensuring 
that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its 
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments 
to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates.



39.		It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus 
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated.  It is 
stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them 
on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty 
long period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more 
wages or salaries for doing similar work.  The employees before us were 
engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on a wage that was 
made known to them.  There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not 
being paid.  Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by 
themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those 
who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.  No 
right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such 
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and 
made permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be 
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.  There is no fundamental 
right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on 
contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.  
As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, 
since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments 
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.  
The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily 
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who 
were regularly employed.  That would be treating unequals as equals.   It 
cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even 
though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment 
rules.  The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are 
therefore overruled.",
Article 14,"Ramana Dayaram Shetty vs The International Airport Authority Of ... on 4 May, 1979",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1281050/?formInput=Article%2014,,"This Court  accepted the  rule as  valid and  applicable  in
India in  A. S.	 Ahuwalia v.  Punjab(2)	 and  in  subsequent
decision given	in  Sukhdev  v.	 Bhagatram,(3)	Mathew,	 J.,
quoted	the   above-referred  observations  of	Mr.  Justice
Frankfurter with  approval. It	may be noted that this rule,
though supportable  also as  emanation from Article 14, does
not rest  merely on  that article.  It	has  an	 independent
existence  apart   from	 Article 14.	It   is	 a  rule  of
administrative law  which has  been judicially	evolved as a
check against  exercise of  arbitrary power by the executive
authority. If  we  turn	 to  the  judgment  of	Mr.  Justice
Frankfurter and	 examine it,  we find that he has not sought
to draw support for the rule from the equality clause of the
United States  Constitution, but evolved it purely as a rule
of administrative  law. Even in England, the recent trend in
administrative law  is in  that direction as is evident from
what  is   stated  at	pages	540-41	 in   Prof.   Wade's
Administrative Law  4th edition.  There is  no reason why we
should hesitate	 to  adopt  this  rule	as  a  part  of	 our
continually  expanding	administrative	law.  To-  day	with
tremendous  expansion	of  welfare   and   social   service
functions,  increasing	control	 of  material  and  economic
resources and  large  scale  assumption	 of  industrial	 and
commercial  activities	by  the	 State,	 the  power  of	 the
executive Government  to affect	 the lives  of the people is
steadily growing.  The attainment  of socio-economic justice
being a	 conscious end	of State policy, there is a vast and
inevitable increase  in the  frequency with  which  ordinary
citizens come  into relationship  of direct  encounter	with
State power-holders.  This renders it necessary to structure
and restrict  the power of the executive Government so as to
prevent its arbitrary application or
(1) 359 U. S. 535: 3 Law.Ed. (Second series) 1012
(2) [1975] 3. S. C. R. 82.



 This rule	also flows  directly from  the	doctrine  of
equality embodied  in Art.  14. It  is now well settled as a
result of  the decisions  of this  Court hl E. P. Rayappa v.
State cf  Tamil	 Nadu(l)  and  Maneka  Gandhi  v.  Union  of
India(2) that  Article 14  strikes at arbitrariness in State
action and  ensures fairness  and equality  of treatment. It
requires that State action must not be arbitrary but must be
based on  some rational and relevant principle which is non-
discriminatory: it  must not  be guided by any extraneous or
irrelevant considerations,  because that  would be denial of
equality. The  principle of  reasonableness and	 rationality
which is  legally as  well as  philosophically an  essential
element of  equality or	 non-arbitrariness is  protected  by
Article 14  and it  must characterise  every  State  action,
whether it  be under  authority of  law or  in	exercise  of
executive power	 without making	 of law.  The State  cannot,
therefore act  arbitrarily in  entering	 into  relationship,
contractual or	otherwise with a third party, but its action
must conform  to some standard or norm which is rational and
non-discriminatory. This   principle  was   recognised	 and
applied by a Bench of this Court presided over by Ray, C.J.,
in Erusian  Equipment and  Chemicals v. State of West Bengal
(supra) where  the learned  Chief Justice  pointed out	that
""the State  can carry  on executive function by making a law
or without  making a  law. The	exercise of  such powers and
functions in  trade by	the State  is subject to Part III of
the Constitution.  Article 14  speaks of equality before the
law  and   equal  protection   of  the	 laws.	Equality  of
opportunity should apply to matters of public contracts. The
State has  the right  to trade. The State has there the duty
to observe  equality. An  ordinary individual can choose not
to deal	 with any  person The  Government cannot  choose  to
exclude persons	 by  discrimination.  The  order  of  black-
listing has  the effect of depriving a person of equality of
opportunity in	the matter  of public contract. A person who
is on the approved list is unable to enter into advantageous
relations with	the  Government	 because  of  the  order  of
blacklisting.... A  citizen  has  a  right  to	claim  equal
treatment to  enter into  a contract  which may	 be  proper,
necessary and  essential to his lawful calling....It is true
that neither the petitioner nor the respondent has any right
to enter  into a  contract but	they are  entitled to  equal
treatment with others who offer tender or quotations for the
purchase of the

     The Court	referred to  the offer	made by a well known
manufacturer of	 bidis for  purchase of	 the entire  crop of
kendu leaves for a sum of Rs. 3 crores which was turned down
by  the	 Government  and  expressed  its  surprise  that  no
explanation was attempted to be given on behalf of the State
as to  why such an offer, from which the State stood to gain
more than  Rs. 1  crore, was  rejected by the Government. It
will  be  seen	from  this  judgment  that  restricting	 the
invitation to  submit tenders  to a limited class of persons
was held to be violative of the equality clause, because the
classification	did   not  bear	 any.  just  and  reasonable
relation to  the  object  sought  to  be  achieved,  namely,
selling of  kendu leaves  in the interest of general public.
The standard  or  norm	laid  down  by	the  Government	 for
entering into  contracts of  sale of tendu leaves with third
parties was  discriminatory and could not stand the scrutiny
of Article 14 and  hence the scheme was held to be invalid.
The Court  rejected the contention of the Government that by
reason of  section 10  it was  entitled to  dispose of kendu
leaves in  such manner	as it  thought fit  and there was no
limitation upon	 its power  to enter into contracts for sale
of kendu  leaves with  such persons it liked. The Court held
that the  Government was,  in the  exercise of	its power to
enter into  contracts for  sale of  kendu leaves; subject to
the constitutional limitation of Article 14 and it could not
act arbitrarily in selecting persons with whom to enter into
contracts and discriminate against others similarly situate.
The Court criticised

the Government	for not	 giving any explanation as to why an
offer for  a large  amount was	not accepted,  the  clearest
implication being that the Government must act in the public
interest; it  cannot act  arbitrarily and without reason and
if it does so, its action would be liable to be invalidated.
This decision  wholly supports	the view  we are  taking  in
regard	to   The   applicability   of	the   rule   against
arbitrariness in State action. B
     We may also in this connection refer to the decision of
this Court  in C.  K. Achuthan	v. State of Kerala(1), where
Hidayatullah, J.,  speaking on	behalf	of  The	 Court	made
certain observation which was strongly relied upon on behalf
of the	respondents. The  facts of  this case  were that the
petitioner and	the 3rd	 respondent Co-operative Milk Supply
Union, Cannanore,  submitted tenders  for the supply of milk
to the	Government hospital  at Cannanore for the year 1948-



49. The	 Superintendent who scrutinised the tenders accepted
that of	 the petitioner and communicated the reasons for the
decision to  the Director  of Public  Health. The  resulting
contract  in   favour  of   the	 petitioner   was,  however,
subsequently cancelled	by issuing  a  notice  in  terms  of
clause (2)  of the tender, in pursuance of the policy of the
Government that	 in  the  matter  of  supply  to  Government
Medical Institutions  the  Co-operative	 Milk  Supply  Union
should be given contract on the basis of prices filed by the
Revenue Department.  The petitioner  challenged The decision
of the	Government in  a petition  under Article  32 of	 the
Constitution on	 the ground  inter alia	 that there had been
discrimination against	him vis-a-vis the 3rd respondent and
as such,  there was  contravention  of	Article 14  of	 the
Constitution.	The   Constitution   Bench   rejected	this
contention  of	 the  petitioner   and	 while	 doing	 so,
Hidayatullah, J.,  made the following observation: ""There is
no discrimination,  because it	is  perfectly  open  to	 the
Government, even  as it	 is to	a private party, to choose a
person to  their liking, to fulfil contracts which they wish
to be  performed. When	one person  is choosen	rather	than
another, the  aggrieved party cannot claim the protection of
Article 14,  because the  choice of  the person	 to fulfil a
particular contract  must be  left to  the Government.""	 The
respondents relied  very strongly  on  this  observation  in
support of  their contention  that it is open to the 'State'
to enter  into contract	 with any  one it likes and choosing
one person  in preference  to another  for entering  into  a
contract does  not involve  violation of  Article 1a. Though
the language  in which this observation is couched is rather
wide, we  do not  think that in making this observation, the
Court.	intended   to  lay  down  any  absolute	 proposition
permitting the	state to  act arbitrarily  in the  matter of
entering into contract with

aforesaid two orders, has conceded the issue raised in these cases.



This assumes importance in view of the plea of Shri Divan that the

impugned judgments should be set aside on the ground that when

the arbitral awards did not provide for solatium or interest, no

Section 34 petition having been filed by the landowners on this

score, the Division Bench judgments that are impugned before us

ought not to have allowed solatium and/or interest. Ordinarily, we

would have acceded to this plea, but given the fact that the

Government itself is of the view that solatium and interest should be

granted even in cases that arise between 1997 and 2015, in the

interest of justice we decline to interfere with such orders, given our

discretionary jurisdiction under Article 136 of the Constitution of

India. We therefore declare that the provisions of the Land

Acquisition Act relating to solatium and interest contained in Section

23(1A) and (2) and interest payable in terms of section 28 proviso

will apply to acquisitions made under the National Highways Act.

Consequently, the provision of Section 3J is, to this extent, violative

of Article 14 of the Constitution of India and, therefore, declared to

be unconstitutional. Accordingly, Appeal @ SLP (C) No. 9599/2019

is dismissed.",

The  judgment  of A. N. RAY, C. J. D. G. PALEKAR and  Y.  V.
CHANDRACHUD  J.J. was delivered by Chandrachud,	 J.  KRISHNA
IYER, J.  delivered a separate concerning Opinion on  behalf
of Bhagwati.  J. and	 himself.
CHANDRACHUD, J. If persons  drawn from different sources are
integrated  into  one  class, can they'	 be  classified	 for
purposes  of  promotion on the basis  of  their	 educational
qualifications?	 That is the issue for consideration  before
us.
Respondents,  who are Diploma Holders in Engineering,  filed
in  the	 High Court of Jammu and Kashmir  a  petition  under
article 226 of the Constitution to challenge the validity of
certain Service Rules framed by the Government of Jammu	 and
Kashmir.  A Learned single Judge dismissed the petition	 but
in  appeal a Division Bench of the High Court took the	view
that the impugned rules were violative of articles 14 and 16
of  the	 Constitution.	 The correctness  of  that  view  is



The  case of the respondents as disclosed in their  petition
was that under the, rules of 1939, Assistant Engineers	were
entitled to be promoted to the higher cadre on the basis  of
their  merit and record and no distinction was made  between
degree-holders and diploma holders for the purposes of	such
promotion.   The discrimination made by the  impugned  rules
between degree-holders and diploma-holders was arbitrary and
capricious because academic or technical qualifica-
7 77
tions could be germane only at the time of recruitment.	 For
purposes of promotion, efficiency and experience alone	must
count.	  Respondents  further	contended  that	  once	 the
Government  appointed candidates with different academic  or
technical qualifications to the same cadre, having the same,
pay scale and similar duties, such candidates would form one
class and they cannot be further classified for purposes  of
promotion on the basis of their educational  qualifications.
The,  impugned rules, according to the respondents,  brought
about	a  reduction  in  rank,	 deprived  them	  of   equal
opportunity in the matter of promotion and were violative of
articles 14 and 16 of the constitution of India.   Finally,
the respondents contended by their petition that it was	 not
competent to the Government to change the service conditions
unilaterally- to the disadvantage of its employees so as  to
deprive	 them of their vested right of promotion  by  giving
retrospective effect to the rules.



Most of the arguments advanced for the respondents have been
considered  and rejected by this Court in some case  or	 the
other  but before coming to that, a few points may, be	kept
out of way.
An  argument which found favour with Mufti Bahauddin  J.,one
of  the	 learned Judges of the Letters Patent Bench  of	 the
High  Court,  and which was repeated before us is  that	 the
""retrospective""	  application  of  the	impugned  rules	  is
violative  of articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. It  is
difficult  to  appreciate this argument	 and  impossible  to
accept	it. It is wrong to characterise the operation  of  a
service rule   as  retrospective  for  the  reason  that  it
applies to existing employees. A rule which classifies	such
employees for promotional purposes, undoubtedly operates  on
those who entered service before the framing of	  the	rule
but it operates in future, in the sense that it governs	 the
future	right  of  promotion of those  who  are	 already  in
service. The   impugned	 rules	do not	recall	a  promotion
already made or reduce a pay-scale  already  granted.	They
provide,  for a classification by prescribing a	 qualitative
standard,  the	measure of that standard  being	 educational
attainment.  Whether  a	 classification founded	 on  such  a
consideration suffers from a discriminatory vice is  another
matter	  which	 we will presently consider but surely,	 the
rule cannot first be	 assumed  to  be  retrospective	 and
then  be  struck down for the reason that  it  violates	 the
guarantee  of equal opportunity by extending its  arms	over
the  past. If rules governing conditions of  service  cannot
ever operate  to the prejudice of those who are	 already  in
service,  the  age of superannuation  should  have  remained
immutable and schemes of compulsory  retirement	 in   public
interest ought to have foundered on	the	rock	  of
retroactivity.	 But  such  is,	 not  the   implication	  of
'servicerules  nor is it their true description to say	that
because they affect I	 existing    employees	 they	 are
retrospective. It is well-settled that though	  employment
under the Government like that under any other master  may
have a contractual origin, the Government servant acquires a
status'	 on  appointment  to his office. As  a	result,	 his
rights and obliga-



   This argument, as presented, is attractive but it assumes
in  the	 court a right of scrutiny somewhat  wider  than  is
generally recognized.  Article 16 of the Constitution  which
ensures	 to all citizens equality of opportunity in  matters
relating to employment is but an instance or incident of the
guarantee of equality contained in article 14.	The  concept
of   equal  opportunity	 undoubtedly  permeates	 the   whole
spectrum  of  an individual's  employment  from	 appointment
through promotion and termination to the payment of gratuity
and  pension.  But the concept of equality has	an  inherent
limitation   arising   from   the   very   nature   of	 the
constitutional guarantee.  Equality is for equals.  That  is
to  say	 that  those who  are  similarly  circumstanced	 are
entitled to an equal treatment.",

judges	of this Court in Khudiram Das v. The State  of	West
Bengal	 &  Ors.(1)  Interestingly,  even  prior  to   these
decisions, as pointed out by Dr. Rajive Dhawan, in his	book
: ""The Supreme Court of India :"" at page 235, reference	 was
made,  by this court in Mohd.  Sabir v. State of  Jammu	 and
Kashmir(2)  to article 191(2) to justify preventive;  deten-
tion.	The  law, must, therefore, now be taken to  be	well
settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19 and that
even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving
a person of 'personal liberty' and there is consequently  no
infringement  of the fundamental right conferred by  Article
21,  such  law, in so far as it abridges or takes  away	 any
fundamental  right under Article 19 would have to  meet	 the
challenge  of that article. This proposition can no  longer
be  disputed  after the decisions in R.	 C.  Cooper's  case,
Shambhu	 Nath Sarkar's case and Haradhan Saha's case.	Now,
if  a  law  depriving a person	of  'personal  liberty'	 and
prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the  meaning
of  Article 21 has to stand the test of one or more  of	 the
fundamental  rights conferred under Article 19 which may  be
applicable  in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must	also
be  liable to be tested with reference to Article 14. This
was in fact not disputed by the learned Attorney General and
indeed	he  could  not	do  so in  view	 of  the  clear	 and
categorical  statement	made  by Mukharjea,  J.,  in  A.  K.
Gopalan's case that Article 21 ""presupposes that the law  is
a  valid  and  binding	law  under  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution   having  regard  to  the	competence  of	 the
legislature  and  the  subject it relates to  and  does	 not
infringe   any	 of  the  fundamental	rights	 which	 the
Constitution  provides	for"", including	 Article 14. This
Court  also  applied  Article 14  in  two  of	its  earlier
decisions,  namely,  The State of West Bengal v.  Anwar	 Ali
Sarkar(3)   and	  Kathi	 Raning	 Rawat	v.  The	  State	  of
Saurashtra(4)  where there was a special law  providing	 for
trial  of certain offences by a speedier process which	took
away  some of the safeguards available to an  accused  under
the ordinary procedure in the Criminal Procedure Code. The
special	 law  in each of these two cases  undoubtedly  pres-
cribed	a procedure for trial of the specified offences	 and
this  procedure could not be condemned as inherently  unfair
or unjust and there was thus compliance with the requirement
of Article 21, but even so, the validity of the special	 law
was  tested before the Supreme, Court on the  touchstone  of
Article 14  and in one case, namely, Kathi  Raning  Rawat's
case,  the  validity was upheld and in	the  other,  namely,
Anwar Ali Sarkar's case, it was struck down.  It was held in
both  these  cases  that the procedure	established  by	 the
special	 law must not be violative of the  equality  clause.
That procedure must answer the requirement of Article 14.
The  nature and requirement of the procedure  under  article



21.
Now,  the  question  immediately arises as to  what  is	 the
requirement of Article 14 : what is the content and reach of
the great equalising principle enunciated in this article  ?
There  can  be no doubt that it is a founding faith  of	 the
Constitution.  It is indeed the pillar on which

rests  securely the foundation of our  democratic  republic.
And,  therefore,  it  must not be  subjected  to  a  narrow,
pedantic  or lexicographic approach._ No attempt  should  be
made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for, to
do so would be to violate its activist magnitude.   Equality
is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it
cannot	be  imprisoned Within  traditional  and	 doctrinaire
limits.	 We must reiterate here what was pointed out by	 the
majority  in E. P. Royappa v. State of Tamil Nadu &  Another
(1)  namely,  that  ""from  a  positivistic  point  of  view,
equality  is antithetic to arbitrariness.  In fact  equality
and arbitrariness are sworn enemies; one belongs to the rule
of  law	 in  a republic, while the other, to  the  whim	 and
caprice of an absolute monarch.	 Where an act is  arbitrary,
it  is implicit in it that it is unequal both  according  to
political  logic  and constitutional law  and  is  therefore
violative  of  Article 14"". Article 14	 strikes,  at  arbi-
trariness in State action and ensures fairness and  equality
of  treatment.	 The  principle	 of  reasonableness,   which
legally as well as philosophically, is an essential  element
of equality or non-arbitrariness pervades Article 14 like  a
brooding  omnipresence	and the	 procedure  contemplated  by
Article	 21 must answer the best of reasonableness in  order
to be in conformity with Article 14.  It must be ""'right and
just  and fair"" and not arbitrary, fanciful  or	 oppressive;
otherwise,  it	would  be  no  procedure  at  all  and	 the
requirement of Article 21 would not be satisfied.
How  far  natural  justice  is	air  essential	element	  of
procedure established by law.



	      2.The  representation  of	 the  petitioner
	      will be dealt with expeditiously in accordance
	      with law.
This  statement removes the voice from the order  impounding
the passport and it can no longer be assailed on the  ground
that it does not comply with the audi alteram partem rule or
is.  not  in  accord with the procedure	 prescribed  by	 the
Passports Act, 1967.
Is Section 10(3) (c) violative of Article 14 ?
That takes us to the next question whether section 10(3) (c)
is  violative  of any of the fundamental  rights  guaranteed
under  Part III of the Constitution.  Only two	articles  of
the  Constitution are relied upon for this purpose and	they
are  Articles 14  and 19 (1) (a) and (g).   We	 will  first
dispose of the challenge based on Article 14 as it lies in a
very  narrow  compass.	 The argument tinder  this  head  of
challenge, was that

section	 10(3) (c) confers unguided and unfettered power  on
the Passport Authority to impound a passport and hence it is
violative  of the equality clause contained in	Article 14.
It  was conceded that under section 10 (3) (c) the power  to
impound a passport can be exercised only upon one or more of
the,  stated grounds, but the complaint was that the  ground
of  ""interests	of the general public"". was  too  vague	 and
indefinite  to	afford	any real guidance  to  the  Passport
Authority  and the Passport Authority could, without in	 any
way violating the terms of the section, impound the passport
of one and not of another, at its discretion.  Moreover,  it
was  said that when the order impounding a passport is	made
by  the Central Government, there is no appeal	or  revision
provided  by  the Statute and the decision  of	the  Central
Government  that  it  is in public  interest  to  impound  a
passport is final and conclusive.  The discretion vested  in
the  Passport  Authority, and particularly  in	the  Central
Government, is thus unfettered and unrestricted and this  is
plainly	 in violation of Article 14.  Now, the law  is	well
settled that when a statute vests unguided and	unrestricted
power  in  an  authority to affect the rights  of  a  person
without	 laying	 down any policy or principle  which  is  to
guide  the authority in exercise of this power, it would  be
affected by the vice of discrimination since it would  leave
it open to the Authority to discriminate between persons and
things similarly situated.  But here it is difficult to	 say
that  the discretion conferred on the Passport Authority  is
arbitrary or unfettered.  There are four grounds set out  in
section 10(3) (c) which would justify the making of an order
impounding a passport.	We are concerned only with the	last
ground denoted by the words ""in the interests of the general
public"",  for that is the ground which is attacked as  vague
and indefinite.	 We fail to see how this ground can, by	 any
stretch of argument, be characterised as vague or undefined.
The  words ""in the interests of the general public""  have  a
clearly well defined meaning and the courts have often	been
called upon to decide whether a particular action is ""in the
interests of the general public"" or in ""public interest"" and
no difficulty has been experienced by the Courts in carrying
out  this  exercise.   These  words  are  in  fact  borrowed
ipsissima verba from Article 19(5) and we think it would  be
nothing short of heresy to accuse the constitution makers of
vague  and  loose  thinking.  The  legislature	performed  a
scissor	 and paste operation in lifting these words  out  of
Article 19(5) and introducing them in section 10(3) (c)	 and
if  these  words  are not vague and  indefinite	 in  Article
19(5),	it is difficult to see bow they can be condemned  to
be  such  when	they occur in section 10(3)  (c).   How	 can
section	 10(3)	(c)  be said  to  incur	 any  constitutional
infirmity  on account of these words when they are no  wider
than  the  constitutional  provision in	 Article  19(5)	 and
adhere	loyally	 to  the  verbal  formula  adopted  In	 the
Constitution  ? We are clearly of the view  that  sufficient
guidelines  are provided by the, words ""in the interests  of
the general public"" and the power conferred on the  Passport
Authority  to  impound	a  passport cannot  be	said  to  be
unguided  or  unfettered.  Moreover, it must  be  remembered
that the exercise of this power is not made dependent on the
subjective opinion of the Passport Authority as regards	 the
necessity  of  exercising it on one or more of	the  grounds
stated	in  the	 section,  but	the  Passport  Authority  is
required to record in writing a brief statement of reasons
for impounding the passport and, save in cer-",

     The next  question which  false to	 be  considered	 is,
""Does Article 14 make	any difference	to the	consequences
which flow  from the  second proviso  to Article 311(2)?"" It
was submitted  on behalf  of the  government  servants	that
Article 14  in which  the principle  of natural	 justice are
comprehended  permeates	  the	entire	 Constitution	and,
therefore, Article 14 must  be read into the second proviso
to Article  311(2) and	according if  not under that proviso
read by	 itself, under	it read with Article 14 a government
servant is  entitled to an opportunity both of showing cause
against the  charges made  against him	as also	 against the
penalty	 proposed  to  be  imposed  upon  him,	though	such
opportunity may	 not extend to the holding of a complete and
elaborate inquiry  as would  be the case where clause (2) of
Article 311  applies. According	 to learned  Counsel this is
what is	 required by  the audi	alteram partem rule which is
one of	the two	 main principles  of natural Justice. In the
alternative it	was submitted  that though  an order  may be
valid and  supportable under  the second  proviso to Article
311(2), it  could none	the less be void under Article 14 on
the ground  that the principles of natural justice have been
wholly	disregarded.  These  arguments	are  based  upon  an
imperfect understanding of the principles of natural justice
in their application in courts of law to the adjudication of
causes before  them and the function of Article 14 vis-a-vis
the other  provisions of  the Constitution  and particularly
the second proviso to Article 311(2).



 Article 14	 contains a guarantee of equality before the
law  to	 all  persons  and  a  protection  to  them  against
discrimination by  any law.  Sub-clause (a) of clause (3) of
Article 13 defines law as follows:
	  ""'law' includes  any	Ordinance,  order,  bye-law,
	  rule, regulation,  notification, custom  or  usage
	  having in  the territory  of India  the  force  of
	  law"".
What Article 14 forbids  is discrimination by law, that is,
treating  persons  similarly  circumstanced  differently  or
treating those	not similarly  circumstanced in the same way
or, as has been pithily put, treating equals as unequals and
unequals   as	equals.	  Article 14	 prohibits   hostile
classification by law and is directed against discriminatory
class legislation. The propositions deducible from decisions
of this court on this point have

been set  out in  the form  of thirteen	 propositions in the
judgment of  Chandrachud, C.J.,	 in In Re The Special Courts
Bill, 1978.  The first of these propositions which describes
the nature of the two parts of Article 14 has been extracted
earlier. We  are not  concerned in  these Appeals  and	Writ
Petitions with	the  other  propositions  set  out  in	that
judgment. In  early days,  this	 Court	was  concerned	with
discriminatory and  hostile class  legislation and it was to
this aspect  of Article 14 that its attention was directed.
As fresh thinking began to take place on the scope an anoint
of Article 14, new dimensions to this guarantee of equality
before the  law and  of the  equal protection  of  the	laws
emerged and  were recognized  by this Court. It was realized
that to treat one person differently from another when there
was no	rational basis	for doing  so would be arbitrary act
thus discriminatory.  Arbitrariness can	 take many forms and
shapes but  whatever form  or shape it takes, it is none the
less discrimination. It also became apparent that to treat a
persons or a class of persons unfairly would be an arbitrary
act amounting  to discrimination  forbidden by	Article 14.
Similarly, this	 Court, recognized that to treat a person in
violation of  the principles of natural justice would amount
to arbitrary  and discriminatory treatment and would violate
the guarantee given by Article 14.



	  ""Article 14  is the  genus while  Article 16	is a
	  species, Article  16 gives  effect to the doctrine
	  of equality  in all  matters	relating  to  public
	  employment. The  basic principle which, therefore,
	  informs both	Articles 14  and 16  is equality and
	  inhibition against  discrimination. Now,  what  is
	  the content  and reach  of this  great  equalizing
	  principle? It is a founding

	  faith, to  use the  words of	Bose, J.,  'a way of
	  life', and  it must  not be  subjected to a narrow
	  pedantic  or	lexicographic  approach.  We  cannot
	  countenance  any  attempt  to	 truncate  its	all-
	  embracing scope and meaning, for to do so would be
	  to violate  its activist  magnitude. Equality is a
	  dynamic concept  with many  aspects and dimensions
	  and it  cannot be  'cribbed, cabined and confined'
	  within traditional  and doctrinaire limits. From a
	  positivistic point of view, equality is qutithetic
	  to   arbitrariness.	 In   fact    equality	 and
	  arbitrariness are  sworn enemies;  one belongs  to
	  the rule  of law in a republic while the other, to
	  the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch. Where
	  an act  is arbitrary	it is implicit in it that it
	  is unequal  both according  to political logic and
	  constitutional law  and is  therefore violative of
	  Article 14,  and if it effects any matter relating
	  to public  employment, it  is	 also  violative  of
	  Article  16. Article 14   and  16	 strike	  at
	  arbitrariness in  State action and ensure fairness
	  and equality of treatment. They require that State
	  action must be based on valent relevant principles
	  applicable alike  to all  similarly situate and it
	  must not be guided by any extraneous or Irrelevant
	  coordinations because	 that  would  be  denial  of

The question in Gopalan's case and Cooper's case was whether
particular Articles guaranting certain Fundamental Rights

operated exclusively  without having any inter-relation with
any other Article in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights. This
is not	the question  before us.  Neither Article  19 or  21
excludes the  operation of the other Articles in Part III of
the  Constitution. Where  however,   an  Article   in	 the
Constitution expressly	excludes the  application of certain
Fundamental Rights,  the view taken in Cooper's case and the
other cases  which followed it, namely, that the Articles in
the  Chapter   on  Fundamental	Rights	do  not	 operate  in
isolation, cannot  apply. Article  13  invalidates  any	 law
which violates any of the Fundamental Rights. Article 31A(1)
provides that ""Notwithstanding anything contained in article
13, no law providing for ..... shall be deemed to be void on
the ground  that it  is inconsistent  with, or takes away or
abridges any  of the  rights conferred	by  article 14	 and
article 19"".  Under  Article  31B,  none  of  the  Acts	 and
Regulations  specified	 in  the   Ninth  schedule   to	 the
Constitution nor  any of  the provisions  thereof are  to be
deemed to be void on the ground that such Act, Regulation or
provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any
of the	rights conferred  by any  provisions  of  Part	III.
Article	 31C   provides	  that	 ""Notwithstanding   anything
contained in  Article 13, no law giving effect to the policy
of the	State towards  securing .  . . shall be deemed to be
void on	 the ground  that it  is inconsistent with, or takes
away or	 abridges any  of the rights conferred by article 14
or article  19 .  . . "". Gan it then be contended in face of
these express  provisions in  the Constitution that none the
less Article 14 will  apply to	 the  provisions  of  a	 law
specified in  Article 31A(1)  or 31B  or 31C?  Clause(2)  of
Article 311  is an  express statement of what the right of a
fair hearing  guaranteed by  Article 14 would require and by
the opening  words of the second proviso to that clause that
right is  expressly taken away, and R.C.Cooper's case cannot
be invoked  to reintroduce  that right on the ground that it
flows by  implication from  Article 14. If the contention of
the petitioner	that in	 all cases  there must be a right of
hearing before an order is made to a person's prejudice were
correct, the  result would  be startling  and anomalous. For
instance inspite  of Article  21 & 22 no person can be taken
in preventive  detention unless	 he has	 been first given an
opportunity of	showing cause  against the  proposed action.
Results such as these would make a mockery of the provisions
of the Constitution.",
Article 14,"Secretary, State Of Karnataka And ... vs Umadevi And Others on 10 April, 2006",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1591733/?formInput=Article%2014,,"32.		At this stage, it is relevant to notice two aspects.  In 
Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet of 
Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, ""



33.		In the earlier decision in Indra Sawhney Vs. Union of India 
[1992 Supp. (2) S.C.R. 454), B.P. Jeevan Reddy, J. speaking for the 
majority, while acknowledging that equality and equal opportunity is a basic 
feature of our Constitution, has explained the exultant  position of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India in the scheme of things.  His Lordship 
stated:-

""6. The significance attached by the founding fathers to 
the right to equality is evident not only from the fact that 
they employed both the expressions 'equality before the 
law' and 'equal protection of the laws' in Article 14 but 
proceeded further to state the same rule in positive and 
affirmative terms in Articles 15 to 
18






Thus, it is clear that adherence to the rule of equality in public employment 
is a basic feature of our Constitution and since the rule of law is the core of 
our Constitution, a Court would certainly be disabled from passing an order 
upholding a violation of Article 14 or in ordering the overlooking of the 
need to comply with the requirements of Article 14 read with Article 16 of 
the Constitution.  Therefore, consistent with the scheme for public 
employment, this Court while laying down the law, has necessarily to hold 
that unless the appointment is in terms of the relevant rules and after a 
proper competition among qualified persons, the same would not confer any 
right on the appointee.  If it is a contractual appointment, the appointment 
comes to an end at the end of the contract, if it were an engagement or 
appointment on daily wages or casual basis, the same would come to an end 
when it is discontinued.  Similarly, a temporary employee could not claim to 
be made permanent on the expiry of his term of appointment.  It has also to 
be clarified that merely because a temporary employee or a casual wage 
worker is continued for a time beyond the term of his appointment, he would 
not be entitled to be absorbed in regular service or made permanent, merely 
on the strength of such continuance, if the original appointment was not 
made by following a due process of selection as envisaged by the relevant 
rules.  It is not open to the court to prevent regular recruitment at the 
instance of temporary employees whose period of employment has come to 
an end or of ad hoc employees who by the very nature of their appointment, 
do not acquire any right.  High Courts acting under Article 226 of the 
Constitution of India, should not ordinarily issue directions for absorption, 
regularization, or permanent continuance unless the recruitment itself was 
made regularly and in terms of the constitutional scheme.  Merely because, 
an employee had continued under cover of an order of Court, which we have 
described as 'litigious employment' in the earlier part of the judgment, he 
would not be entitled to any right to be absorbed or made permanent in the 
service.  In fact, in such cases, the High Court may not be justified in issuing 
interim directions, since, after all, if ultimately the employee approaching it 
is found entitled to relief, it may be possible for it to mould the relief in such 
a manner that ultimately no prejudice will be caused to him, whereas an 
interim direction to continue his employment would hold up the regular 
procedure for selection or impose on the State the burden of paying an 
employee who is really not required.  The courts must be careful in ensuring 
that they do not interfere unduly with the economic arrangement of its 
affairs by the State or its instrumentalities or lend themselves the instruments 
to facilitate the bypassing of the constitutional and statutory mandates.



39.		It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus 
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated.  It is 
stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them 
on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty 
long period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more 
wages or salaries for doing similar work.  The employees before us were 
engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on a wage that was 
made known to them.  There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not 
being paid.  Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by 
themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those 
who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.  No 
right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such 
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and 
made permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be 
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.  There is no fundamental 
right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on 
contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.  
As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, 
since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments 
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.  
The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily 
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who 
were regularly employed.  That would be treating unequals as equals.   It 
cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even 
though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment 
rules.  The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are 
therefore overruled.",

requires it  to conform to such standards of reasonableness,
fairness and  justness as  the Court  acting as	 sentinel of
fundamental rights  would in the context, consider necessary

whether the procedure is reasonable, fair and just. [114D-F]

     P.S. Shah,	 J. to	whom the cases were referred to from
D.N. Mehta,  J. On  24th of July, 1986 proceeded to frame as
many as	 79 A  charges against the appellant and decided not
to proceed  against the other named co-conspirators. This is
the  order  impugned  before  us.  Being  aggrieved  by	 the
aforesaid order	 the appellant	filed  the  present  Special
leave Petition	(Crl.) No.  2519  of  1986  questioning	 the
jurisdiction to try the case in violation of the appellant's
fundamental rights   conferred by Articles 14 and 21 and the
provisions of  the Act	of 1952.  The appellant	 also  filed
Special leave  Petition (Crl.)	No. 2518 of 1986 against the
judgment and  order dated 21st of August, 1986 of P.S. Shah,
J. holding  that none  of the  79 charges framed against the
accused required  sanction under section 197(1) of the Code.
The appellant  also filed  a Writ  Petition No.	 542 of 1986
challenging a  portion of  section 197(1)  of Code  as ultra
vires Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.



 In this appeal two questions arise, namely, (1) whether
the directions given by this Court on 16th of February, 1984
in  R.S.   Nayak  v.  A.R.  Antulay,  [1984]  2	 S.C.R.	 495
withdrawing the	 Special Case No. 24/82 and Special Case No.
3/83 arising  out of  the complaint  filed by  one shri P.B.
Samant pending	in  the	 Court	of  Special  Judge,  Greater
Bombay, Shri  R.B. Sule,  and transferring  the same  to the
High Court  of Bombay with a request to the Chief Justice to
assign these two cases to a sitting Judge of the High Court,
in breach  of section 7(1) of the Act of 1952 which mandates
that offences  as in  this case	 shall be tried by a Special
Judge only  thereby denying  at least one right of appeal to
the appellant  was violative  of Articles 14 and  21 of the
Constitution and  whether such	directions were at all valid
or legal and (2) if such directions were not at all valid or
legal in  view. Of  the order  dated 17th.  Of	April,	1984
referred to  hereinbefore, is this appeal sustainable or the
grounds therein	 justiciable in	 these proceedings. In other
words,- are  711 the said directions in a proceedings inter-
parties binding	 even if bad in law or violative of Articles
14 and	21 of  the Constitution	 and as such are immune from
correction by  this Court  even though	they cause prejudice
and do	injury? These  are the	basic questions	 which	this
Court must answer in this appeal.



     Mr. Rao  for  Antulay  argued  at	length	and  Brother
Mukharji has  noticed all  those  contentions  that  by	 the
change of the forum of the

trial the  accused has been prejudiced. Undoubtedly, by this
process he misses a forum of appeal because if the trial was
handled by  a Special  Judge, the  first appeal would lie to
the High  Court and  further appeal  by special	 leave could
come before  this Court.  If the matter is tried by the High
Court there  would be  only one	 forum of  appeal being this
Court, whether	as of  right or by way of special leave. The
appellant has  also contended  that the	 direction  violates
Article 14  of the  Constitution because  he alone  has been
singled out and picked up for being treated differently from
similarly placed  accused persons.  Some  of  these  aspects
cannot be  overlooked with  ease. I  must, however, indicate
here that the argument based upon the extended meaning given
to the	contents of  Article 21	 of the Constitution, though
attractive have not appealed to me.",

28. Soon after the enforcement of the Constitution two cases reached this Court from the State of Madras - one under Article 15 and the other under Article 16. Both the cases were decided on the same date and by the same Bench. The one arising under Article 15 is State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan [1951] S.C.R. 525, and the other arising under Article 16 is Venkataraman v. State of Madras A.I.R. 1951 S.C. 229. By virtue of certain orders issued prior to coming into force of the Constitution,-popularly known as 'Communal G.O.' - seats in the Medical and Engineering Colleges in the State of Madras were apportioned in the following manner: Non-Brahmin (Hindus)-6, Backward Hindus-2, Brahmin-2, Harijan-2, Anglo Indians and Indian Christians-1, Muslims-1. Even after the advent of the Constitution, the G.O. was being acted upon which was challenged by Smt. Champakam as violative of the fundamental rights guranteed to her by Articles 15(1) and 29(2) of the Constitution of India. A Full Bench of Madras High Court declared the said G.O. as void and un-enforceable with the advent of the Constitution. The State of Madras brought the matter in appeal to this Court. A Special Bench of Seven Judges heard the matter and came to the unanimous conclusion that the allocation of seats in the manner aforesaid is violative of Articles 15(1) and 29(2) inasmuch as the refusal to admit the respondent (writ petitioner) notwithstanding her higher marks, was based only on the ground of caste. The State of Madras sought to sustain the G.O. with reference to Article 46 of the Constitution. Indeed the argument was that Article 46 over-rides Article 29(2). This argument was rejected. The Court pointed out that while in the case of employment under the State, Clause (4) of Article 16 provides for reservations in favour of backward class of citizens, no such provision was made in Article 15.



35. During the years 1968 to 1971, this Court had to consider the validity of identification of backward classes made by Madras and Andhra Pradesh Governments. Minor P.Rajendran v. State of Madras related to specification of socially and educationally backward classes with reference to castes. The question was whether such an identification infringes Article 15. Wanchoo, CJ., speaking for the Constitution Bench dealt with the contention in the following words:

The contention is that the list of socially and educationally backward classes for whom reservation is made under Rule 5 nothing but a list of certain castes. Therefrore, reservation in favour of certain castes based only on caste considerations violates Article 15(1), which prohibits discrimination on the ground of caste only. Now if the reservation in question had been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational backwardness of the caste in question, it would be violative of Article 15(1). But it must not be forgotten that a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as a whole is socially and educationally backward reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the ground that it is a socially and educationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of Article 15(4).... It is true that in the present cases the list of socially and educationally backward classes has been specified by caste. But that does not necessarily mean that caste was the sole consideration and that person belonging to these castes are also not a class of socially and educationally backward citizens.... As it was found that members of these castes as a whole were educationally and socially backward, the list which had been coming on from as far back as 1906 was finally adopted for purposes of Article 15(4)
 
 

In view however of the explanation given by the State of Madras, which has not been controverted by and rejoinder, it must be accepted that though the list shows certain castes, the members of those castes are really classes of educationally and socially backward citizens. No attempt was made on behalf of the petitioners/appellant to show that any caste mentioned in this list was not educationally and socially backward. In this state of the pleadings, we must come to the conclusion that though the list is prepared caste-wise, the castes included therein are as a whole educationally and socially backward and therefore the list is not violative of Article 15. The challenge to Rule 5 must therefore fail.



 Broadly stated, neither caste nor race nor religion can be made the basis of classification for the purposes of determining social and educational backwardness within the meaning of Article 15(4). When Article 15(1) forbids discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, caste cannot be made one of the criteria for determining social and educational backwardness. If caste or religion is recognised as a criterion of social and educational backwardness Article 15(4) will stultify Article 15(1). It is true that Article 15(1) forbids discrimination only on the ground of religion, race, caste but when a classification taken recourse to caste as one of the criteria in determining socially and educationally backward classes the expression ""classes"" in that case violates the rule of expressio unions est exclusio alterius. The socially and educationally backward classes of citizens are groups other than groups based on caste.



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.",

the provisions contained in Article 14. Article 15(4) of the Constitution
carves out an exception for making any special provision for the
advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of
citizens or SCs. and STs. Further protection is conferred under Article
15(5) concerning their admission to educational institutions, including
private educational institutions, whether aided or unaided by the State,
other than the minority educational institutions. Historically
disadvantageous groups must be given special protection and help so that
they can be uplifted from their poverty and low social status as observed
in Kailas & Ors. v. State of Maharashtra, 2011 (1) SCC 793. The
legislature has to attempt such incumbents be protected under Article
15(4), to deal with them with more rigorous provisions as compared to
provisions of general law available to the others would create inequality
which is not permissible/envisaged constitutionally. It would be an action
to negate mandatory constitutional provisions not supported by the
constitutional scheme; rather, it would be against the mandated
constitutional protection. It is not open to the legislature to put members
of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in a disadvantageous
position vis-à-vis others and in particular to so-called upper
castes/general category. Thus, they cannot be discriminated against more
so when we have a peep into the background perspective. What
legislature cannot do legitimately, cannot be done by the interpretative
process by the courts.



3.       It is this idea of India, - a promise of oneness of and for, all people, regardless of
caste, gender, place of birth, religion and other divisions that Part III articulates in four
salient provisions: Article 15, Article 17, Article 23 and Article 24. The idea of fraternity
occupying as crucial a place in the scheme of our nation’s consciousness and polity, is
one of the lesser explored areas in the constitutional discourse of this court. The
fraternity assured by the Preamble is not merely a declaration of a ritual handshake or
cordiality between communities that are diverse and have occupied different spaces: it is
far more. This idea finds articulation in Article 15. 1 That provision, perhaps even more
than Article 14, fleshes out the concept of equality by prohibiting discrimination and
discriminatory practices peculiar to Indian society. At the center of this idea, is that all
people, regardless of caste backgrounds, should have access to certain amenities,
services and goods so necessary for every individual. Article 15 is an important
guarantee against discrimination. What is immediately noticeable is that whereas Article
15 (1) enjoins the State (with all its various manifestations, per Article 12) not to
discriminate on the proscribed grounds (religion, race, caste, sex (i.e. gender), place of
birth or any of them), Article 15 (2) is a wider injunction: it prohibits discrimination or
subjection to any disability of anyone on the grounds of religion, caste, race, sex or place
of birth in regard to access to shops, places of public entertainment, or public restaurants

1    The relevant parts of Article 15 are extracted below:



         (b)      the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly
             out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public…”
     (3)          Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and
         children”
(Article 15 (2) (a)). Article 15(2)(b) proscribes the subjection of anyone to any disability
on the proscribed grounds (i.e. discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, race, sex or
place of birth) with regard to “the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of
public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of
the general public..”





11.      In a similar vein, the court in Nandini Sundar v. State of Chhatisgarh6 again
commented on this aspect and said that “t(T)he Constitution itself, in no uncertain
terms, demands that the State shall strive, incessantly and consistently, to promote
fraternity amongst all citizens such that dignity of every citizen is protected, nourished
and promoted.”
12.      It was to achieve this ideal of fraternity, that the three provisions- Articles 15, 17
and 24 were engrafted. Though Article 17 proscribes the practice of untouchability and
pernicious practices associated with it, the Constitution expected Parliament and the
5     1993 (1) SCR 480
6     2011 (7) SCC 457
legislatures to enact effective measures to root it out, as well as all other direct and
indirect, (but virulent nevertheless) forms of caste discrimination. Therefore, in my
opinion, fraternity is as important a facet of the promise of our freedoms as personal
liberty and equality is. The first attempt by Parliament to achieve that end was the
enactment of the Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955. The Act contained a significant
provision that where any of the forbidden practices “is committed in relation to a
member of a Scheduled Caste” the Court shall presume, unless the contrary is proved,
that such act was committed on the ground of “Untouchability”. This implied that the
burden of proof lies on the accused and not on the prosecution. The Protection of Civil
Rights Act, 1955, followed. This too made provision for prescribing “punishment for the
preaching and practice of - ""Untouchability"" for the enforcement of any disability
arising therefrom”. The enforcement of social practices associated with untouchability
and disabilities was outlawed and made the subject matter of penalties. After nearly 35
years’ experience, it was felt that the 1955 Act (which was amended in 1976) did not
provide sufficient deterrence to social practices, which continued unabated and in a
widespread manner, treating members of the scheduled caste and tribe communities in
the most discriminatory manner, in most instances, stigmatizing them in public places,
virtually denying them the essential humanity which all members of Society are entitled
to.",

31.    Shri K.K. Venugopal, learned Senior Counsel appearing in W.P. 


(Civil)  No.  598  of  2006  contended  that  Articles 15(4)  and  15(5)  are  


mutually   exclusive   with   the   former   concerning   admissions   to   aided 


institutions   and   the   latter   concerning   admissions   to   unaided 


institutions.   Article 15(5)   expressly used the phrase ""whether aided  


or   unaided"",   making   it   clear   that   it   is   not   merely   restricting   itself   to 


unaided   institutions.     Therefore,   it   is   argued   that   from   the   very 


inception of  the  Constitution, Article 15(4)  was   a provision  and  was  


the source of legislative power for the purpose of making reservation  


for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes as well  as the Socially 


and   Educationally   Backward   Classes   of   citizens   in   aided   minority 


educational   institutions.   On   the   other   hand,   Article 15(5),   which  


provides reservation of seats for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs in  


aided   educational   institutions   expressly   excludes   such   reservation 


being   made   at   all   in   minority   educational   institutions   covered   by 


Article 30(1) of the Constitution. According to him,  it would take away  


the valuable rights of OBCs, SCs and STs given by the State under 


Article 15(4) of the Constitution and this would result in annulling the  


endeavour   of   the   founding   fathers   of   the   Constitution   and   would 


result   in   exclusion   of   SCs   and   STs   from   the   mainstream   of   the 


society and stall their development for centuries to come. According 


to the learned Counsel for the petitioners, the argument of the Union 


of India that Article 15(4) and 15(5) are both enabling provisions and 


both will stand together and both can be complied with is incorrect. It 


was   argued   that   Article 15(4)   operates   with   a   qualification   that  


nothing   in   Article 15   or   in   Article   29(2)   of   the   Constitution   shall 


prevent the State from making special provision for SCs and STs as 


well   as   SEBCs   while   Article 15(5)   operates   with   a   qualification   that 


""nothing in Article 15 or Article 19(1)(g)""  shall prevent the State from 


making such special provisions for SCs and STs as well as SEBCs.  



45.    As   regards   exemption   of   minority   educational   institutions   in 


Article 15(5), it was contended that this was done to conform with the  


Constitutional   mandate   of   additional   protection   for   minorities   under 


Article 30.   It was argued that Article 15(5) does not override Article
15(4).     They   have   to   be   read   together   as   supplementary   to   each 


other   and   Article 15(5)   being   an   additional   provision,   there   is   no  


conflict between Article 15(4) and Article 15(5). Article 15(4), 15(5), 


29(2),   30(1),   and   30(2)   all   together   constitute   a   Code   in   relation   to 


admission to educational institutions.  They have to be harmoniously  


construed in the light of the Preamble and Part IV of the Constitution. 



60. Shri  G.E.   Vahanvati,   learned  Solicitor  General of   India  appearing  



on behalf of the Union of India, submitted that the argument of Shri 


Harish Salve, learned Senior Counsel that the American doctrine of 


""strict scrutiny"" should be applied to the affirmative action envisaged 


under Article 15(5) is not correct.   It was  argued that the impugned 


legislation is not  ex facie  discriminatory and, therefore, it cannot be 


classified as a ""suspect legislation"". It was argued that right that from

Subba Rao. J. (as he then was) said that ""the expression `nothing in  


this article'   is a legislative device to express its intention in a most  


emphatic way that the power conferred there under is not limited in  


any way by the main provision but falls outside it"" . The view that 


Articles 15(4)   and   16(4)   are   exceptions   to   Article 15(1)   and   16(1)  


respectively   was   again   reiterated   in  Triloki   Nath  Vs.    State   of 


Jammu   &   Kashmir   &   Ors.   (II)22    and   in  The   State   of   Andhra 


Pradesh & Ors.     Vs.   U.S.V. Balram, Etc23. The learned Solicitor 


General further pointed out that in  State of Kerala & Anr.  Vs   N.M. 


Thomas & Ors.24   the majority opinion held that Articles 14, 15 and  


16   are   parts   of   the   scheme   of   equality   and   that   Articles 15(4)   and  


16(4) are not exceptions to Articles 15(1) and 16(1) respectively. The  


said change in  N.M. Thomas's case  (supra) was noticed by Justice 


Chinnappa   Reddy   in  K.C.   Vasanth   Kumar   &   Anr.      Vs.    State   of 


Karnataka25    and   the   same   view   was   upheld   in  Indra   Sawhney's 


case   (supra).     The   learned   Solicitor   General   further   contended   that 


once it is accepted that Articles 15(4) and 16(4) are not exceptions to  


Articles 15(1)   and   16(1)   respectively,   then   there   is   no   question   of

treating the social welfare measure as being `facially discriminatory'  


or  ""ex facie""  violative of the rule of equality.  It was argued that it is  


not simply a matter of legal equality.  De jure equality must ultimately 


find its  raison d'etre  in  de facto  equality.   The State must, therefore, 


resort   to   compensatory   State   action   for   the   purpose   of   uplifting 


people who are factually unequal in their wealth, education or social  


environment. Relying on the observations of Subba Rao, J. in        T. 


Devadasan's case (supra), it was argued that centuries of calculated 


oppression   and   habitual   submission   has   reduced   a   considerable 


section of our community to a life of serfdom and it would be well nigh 


impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of equal opportunity 


was   strictly   enforced   in   their   case   and   they   would   not   have   any 


change   if   they   were   made   to   enter   the   open   field   of   competition 


without adventitious aids till such time when they could stand on their  


own   legs. Laying   reliance   on   the   observations   made   in  N.M. 


Thomas's case (supra) and also in  Indra Sawhney's case (supra), 


the   learned   Solicitor   General   argued   that   under   Articles 15(4)   and 


16(4) the State is obliged to remove inequalities and backwardness 


from society. It was further submitted that the American doctrine of  


""strict scrutiny"" had been expressly rejected by this Court in Saurabh 


Chaudri   &   Ors.    Vs.      Union   of   India   &   Ors.26      As   regards 


identification   of   backward   classes,   the   learned   Solicitor   General  


contended   that   while   dealing   with   the   aspect   of   identification   of 


backwardness   for   socially   and   educationally   backward   classes,   it 


cannot   be   denied   that   there   is   backwardness   in   this   country;   that 


large sections of the country are socially and educationally backward;



99. It is argued by petitioners' learned Counsel that Article 15(4) and  



15(5)   both   commence   with   an  exclusionary  clause   excluding   the 


operation   of   the   rest   of   the   Article 15,   and   hence   would   result   in   a 


conflict   to   the   extent   of   inconsistency.   According   to   the   petitioners', 


Article 15(5) is a special provision relating to educational institutions  


and being a later amendment, it would prevail over Article 15(4), thus  


in substance and effect resulting in an amendment of Article 15(4) of  


the   Constitution.     According   to   the   petitioner's   Counsel,  ""nothing   in  


this   Article""  in   Article 15(5)   would   include   Article 15(4)   also   and   in 


view of this inconsistent provision, Article 15(5) has to be held to be  


inconsistent with 15(4) and thus non-operative.",
Article 15,"Kailash Chand Sharma vs State Of Rajasthan & Ors on 30 July, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/312106/?formInput=Article%2015,,"There can be little doubt that the impugned circular is the product of
the policy decision taken by the State Government.  Even then, as rightly
pointed out by the High Court, such decision has to pass the test of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution.	If the policy decision, which in the present
case has the undoubted effect of deviating from the normal and salutary rule
of selection based on merit is subversive of the doctrine of equality, it cannot
sustain.  It should be free from the vice of arbitrariness and conform to the
well-settled norms  both positive and negative underlying Articles 14 and
16, which together with Article 15 form part of the Constitutional code of
equality.



	In order to justify the preferential treatment accorded to residents of
the district  and the  rural areas of the district in the matter of selection to the
posts of teachers, the State has come forward with certain pleas either before
the High Court or before this Court.   Some of these pleas are pressed into
service by the learned counsel appearing for the parties who are the possible
beneficiaries under the impugned order of the Govt. Such pleas taken by the
State Government and from which support is sought to be drawn by the
individual parties concerned will be referred to a little later.
Before proceeding further we should steer clear of a misconception
that surfaced in the course of arguments advanced on behalf of the State and
some of the parties.  Based on the decisions which countenanced
geographical classification for certain weighty reasons such as socio-
economic backwardness of the area for the purpose of admissions to
professional colleges, it has been suggested that residence within a district or
rural areas of that district could be a valid basis for classification for the
purpose of public employment as well.  We have no doubt that such a
sweeping argument which has the overtones of parochialism is liable to be
rejected on the plain terms of Article 16(2) and in the light of Art. 16(3).  An
argument of this nature flies in the face of the peremptory language of
Article 16 (2) and runs counter to our constitutional ethos  founded on unity
and integrity of the nation.  Attempts to prefer candidates of a local area in
the State were nipped in the bud by this Court since long past.	 We would
like to reiterate that residence by itself  be it be within a State, region,
district or lesser area within a district cannot be a ground to accord
preferential treatment or reservation, save as provided in Article 16(3). It is
not possible to compartmentalize the State into Districts with a view to offer
employment to the residents of that District on a preferential basis.  At this
juncture it is appropriate to undertake a brief analysis of Article 16.
Article 16 which under clause (1)  guarantees equality of
opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment
to any office under the State reinforces that guarantee by prohibiting under
clause (2) discrimination on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex,
descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.  Be it noted that in the
allied Article Article 15, the word 'residence' is omitted from the opening
clause prohibiting discrimination on specified grounds.	 Clauses (3) and (4)
of Article 16 dilutes the rigour of clause (2) by  (i) conferring an enabling
power on the Parliament to make a law prescribing the residential
requirement within the State in regard to a class or classes of employment or
appointment to an office under the State and (ii) by enabling the State to
make a provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of
any backward class of citizens which is not adequately represented in the
services under the State.  The newly introduced clauses (4-A) and (4-B),
apart from clause (5) of Article 16 are the other provisions by which the
embargo laid down in Article 16 (2) in somewhat absolute terms is lifted to
meet certain specific situations with a view to promote the overall objective
underlying the Article. Here, we should make note of two things: firstly,
discrimination only on the ground of residence (or place of birth) in so far as
public employment is concerned is prohibited; secondly, Parliament is
empowered to make the law prescribing residential requirement within a
State or Union Territory, as the case may be, in relation to a class or classes
of employment.	That means, in the absence of parliamentary law, even the
prescription of requirement as to residence within the State is a taboo.
Coming to the first aspect, it must be noticed that the prohibitory mandate
under Article 16(2) is not attracted if the alleged discrimination is on
grounds not merely related to residence,  but  the factum of residence is only
taken into account in addition to other relevant factors.  This, in effect, is the
import of the expression 'only'.



The lack of material to establish nexus between the geographical
classification and the object sought to be achieved  thereby was thus held to
be violative of Article 14.
 The question which fell for consideration of this Court  whether the
action of the State in Pradip Tandon vs. State of U.P. (1975 (1) SCC 267)
was  in reserving certain percentage of seats available in medical colleges in
favour of candidates from rural areas, hill areas and Uttarakhand was
justified?  The reservation was sought to be justified from the stand point of
Article 15(4).	Repelling the contention, Ray, C.J., speaking  for a three-
Judge Bench observed that ""the Constitution does not enable the State to
bring socially and educationally backward areas within the protection of
Article 15(4)"".	 It was pointed out that the accent in Article 15(4) is on
classes of citizens :



	Though the Court was primarily dealing with an argument based on
Article 15(4) and the import of the expression ""socially and educationally
backward classes of citizens"" occurring in that sub-Article, the observations
quoted above are quite relevant in testing the plea raised on behalf of the
State to save the classification. In the face of what has been laid down in
Pradip Tandon's case, the State cannot possibly invoke Article 16(4).
Our attention has however been drawn to the following observations
in Nidamarti's case (supra) in reiteration of what was said in Pradeep Jain's
case (supra) :",

the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.""

		We are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here.   We 
have to lay down the law. We have to approach the question as a 
constitutional court should.

10.		In addition to the equality clause represented by Article 14 of 
the Constitution, Article 16 has specifically provided for equality of 
opportunity in matters of public employment.  Buttressing these fundamental 
rights, Article 309 provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution, 
Acts of the legislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service 
of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the 
affairs of the Union or of a State.  In view of the interpretation placed on 
Article 12 of the Constitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also 
govern the instrumentalities that come within the purview of Article 12 of 
the Constitution.  With a view to make the procedure for selection fair, the 
Constitution by Article 315 has also created a Public Service Commission 
for the Union and Public Service Commissions for the States.  Article 320 
deals with the functions of Public Service Commissions and mandates 
consultation with the Commission on all matters relating to methods of 
recruitment to civil services and for civil posts and other related matters.  As 
a part of the affirmative action recognized by Article 16 of the Constitution, 
Article 335 provides for special consideration in the matter of claims of the 
members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for employment.  The 
States have made Acts, Rules or Regulations for implementing the above 
constitutional guarantees and any recruitment to the service in the State or in 
the Union is governed by such Acts, Rules and Regulations.  The 
Constitution does not envisage any employment outside this constitutional 
scheme and without following the requirements set down therein.  



30.		In Union Public Service Commission Vs. Girish Jayanti Lal 
Vaghela & Others [2006 (2) SCALE 115], this Court answered the 
question, who was a Government servant and stated:-

""Article 16 which finds place in Part III of the 
Constitution relating to fundamental rights provides that 
there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in 
matters relating to employment or appointment to any 
office under the State.  The main object of Article 16 is to 
create a constitutional right to equality of opportunity and 
employment in public offices.  The words ""employment"" 



32.		At this stage, it is relevant to notice two aspects.  In 
Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet of 
Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, ""



39.		It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus 
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated.  It is 
stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them 
on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty 
long period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more 
wages or salaries for doing similar work.  The employees before us were 
engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on a wage that was 
made known to them.  There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not 
being paid.  Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by 
themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those 
who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.  No 
right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such 
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and 
made permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be 
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.  There is no fundamental 
right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on 
contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.  
As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, 
since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments 
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.  
The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily 
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who 
were regularly employed.  That would be treating unequals as equals.   It 
cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even 
though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment 
rules.  The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are 
therefore overruled.",

Though Balaji was referred to, we must point out with respect that Balaji does not support the above statement. Balaji indeed said that ""though castes in relation to Hindus may be a relevant factor to consider in determining the social backwardness of groups or classes of citizens, it cannot be made the sole or the dominant test in that behalf.""

40. Thomas marks the beginning of a new thinking on Article 16, though the seed of this thought is to be found in the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. The Kerala Government had, by amending Kerala State and Subordinate Service Rules empowered the Government to exempt, by order, for a specified period, any member or members belonging to Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes and already in service, from passing the test which an employee had to pass as a precondition for promotion to next higher post. Exercising the said power, the Government of Kerala issued a notification granting ""temporary exemption to members already in service belonging to any of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes from passing all tests (unified, special or departmental test) for a period of two years"". On the basis of the said exemption, a large number of employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, who had been stagnating in their respective posts for want of passing the departmental tests, were promoted. They were now required to pass the tests within the period of exemption. Out of 51 vacancies which arose in the category of Upper Division Clerks in the year 1972, 34 were filled up by members of Scheduled Castes leaving only 17 for others. This was questioned by Thomas, a member belonging to non-reserved category. His grievance was: but for the said concession/exemption given to members of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes he would have been promoted to one of those posts in view of his passing the relevant tests. He contended that Article 16(4) permits only reservations in favour of backward classes but not such an exemption. This argument was accepted by the Kerala High Court. It also upheld the further contention that inasmuch as more than 50% vacancies in the year had gone to the members of Scheduled Castes as a result of the said exemption, it is bed for violating the 50% rule in Balaji. The Stats of Kerala carried the matter in appeal to this Court which was allowed by a majority of 5:2. All the Seven Judges wrote separate opinions. The head-note to the decision in Supreme Court Reports succinctly sets out the principles enunciated in each of the judgments. We do not wish to burden this judgment by reproducing them here. We would rest content with delineating the broad features emerging from these opinions. Ray, CJ. held that Article 16(1), being a facet of Article 14, permits reasonable classification. Article 16(4) clarifies and explains that classification on the basis of backwardness. Classification of Scheduled Castes does not fall within the mischief of Article 16(2) since Scheduled Castes historically oppressed and backward, are not castes. The concession granted to them is permissible under and legitimate for the purposes of Article 16(1). The rule giving preference to an un-represented or under-represented backward community does not contravene Articles 14, 16(1) or 16(2). Any doubt on this score is removed by Article 16(4). He opined further that for determining whether a reservation is excessive or not one must have to look to the total number of posts in a given unit or department, as the case may be. Mathew, J. agreed that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1), that. Article 16(1) permits reasonable classification and that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2). He espoused the theory of 'proportional equality' evolved in certain American decisions. He does not refer to the decisions in Balaji or Devadasan in his opinion nor does he express any opinion the extent of permissible reservation. Beg, J. adopted a different reasoning. According to him, the rule and the orders issued thereunder was ""a kind of reservation"" falling under Article 16(4) itself. Krishna Iyer,J. was also of the opinion that Article 16(1) being a facet of Article 16 permits reasonable classification, that Article 16(4) is not an exception but an emphatic statement of what is inherent in Article 16(1) and further that Scheduled Castes are not 'castes' within the meaning of Article 16(2) but a collection of castes, races and groups. Article 16(4) is one made of reconciling the claims of backward people and the opportunity for free competition the forward sections are ordinarily entitled to, held the learned Judge. He approved the dissenting opinion of Subba Rao,J. in Devadasan. Fazal Ali, J. too adopted a similar approach. The learned Judge pointed out ""if we read Article 16(4) as an exception to Article 16(1) then the inescapable conclusion would be that Article 16(1) does not permit any classification at all because an express provision has been made for this in Clause (4). This, however, is contrary to the basic concept of equality contained in Article 14 which implicitly permits classification in any form provided certain conditions are fulfilled. Furthermore, if no classification can be made under Article 16(1) except reservation contained in Clause (4) then the mandate contained in Article 335 would be defeated."" He held that the Rule and the orders impugned are referable to and sustainable under Article 16. The learned Judge went further and held that the rule of 50% evolved in Balaji is a mere rule of caution and was not meant to be exhaustive of all categories. He expressed the opinion that the extent of reservation depends upon the proportion of the backward classes to the total population and their representation in public services. He expressed a doubt as to the correctness of the majority view in Devadasan. Among the minority Khanna, J. preferred the view taken in Balaji and other cases to the effect that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). He opined that no preference can be provided in favour of backward classes outside Clause (4). A.C.Gupta, J. concurred with this view.



Question 2(a). Whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is an exception to Clause (1)?

56. In Balaji it was held - ""there is no doubt that Article 15(4) has to be read as a proviso or an exception to Articles 15(1) and 29(2)"". It was observed that Article 15(4) was inserted by the First Amendment in the light of the decision in Champakam, with a view to remove the defect pointed out by this Court namely, the absence of a provision in Article 15 corresponding to Clause (4) of Article 16. Following Balaji it was held by another Constitution Bench (by majority) in Devadasan - ""further this Court has already held that Clause (4) of Article 16 is by way of a proviso or an exception to Clause (1)"". Subbarao, J., however, opined in his dissenting opinion that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it is only an emphatic way of stating the principle inherent in the main provision itself. Be that as it may, since the decision in Devadasan, it was assumed by this Court that Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1). This view, however, received a severe set-back from the majority decision in State of Kerala and Ors. v. N.M. Thomas . Though the minority (H.R. Khanna and A.C. Gupta, JJ.) stuck to the view that Article 16(4) is an exception, the majority (Ray, C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) held that Article 16(4) is not an exception to Article 16(1) but that it was merely an emphatic way of stating a principle implicit in Article 16(1). (Beg. J. took a slightly different view which it is not necessary to mention here). The said four learned Judges - whose views have been referred to in para 41 - held that Article 16(1) being a facet of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 permits reasonable classification just as Article 14 does. In our respectful opinion, the view taken by the majority in Thomas is the correct one. We too believe that Article 16(1) does permit reasonable classification for ensuring attainment of the equality of opportunity assured by it. For assuring equality of opportunity, it may well be necessary in certain situations to treat unequally situated persons unequally. Not doing so, would perpetuate and accentuate inequality. Article 16(4) is an instance of such classification, put in to place the matter beyond controversy. The ""backward class of citizens"" are classified as a separate category deserving a special treatment in the nature of reservation of appointments/posts in the services of the State. Accordingly, we hold that Clause (4) of Article 16 is not exception to Clause (1) of Article 16. It is an instance of classification implicit in and permitted by Clause (1). The speech of Dr. Ambedkar during the debate on draft Article 10(3) [corresponding to Article 16(4)] in the Constituent Assembly - referred to in para 28 - shows that a substantial number of members of the Constituent Assembly insisted upon a ""provision (being) made for the entry of certain communities which have so far been outside the administration"", and that draft Clause (3) was put in recognition and acceptance of the said demand. It is a provision which must be read along with and in harmony with Clause (1). Indeed, even without Clause (4), it would have been permissible for the State to have evolved such a classification and made a provision for reservation of appointments/posts in their favour. Clause (4) merely puts the matter beyond any doubt in specific terms.



Question 2(b): Whether Article 16(4) is exhaustive of the concept of reservations in favour of backward classes?

57. The question than arises whether Clause (4) of Article 16 is exhaustive of the topic of reservations in favour of backward classes. Before we answer this question it is well to examine the meaning and content of the expression ""reservation"". Its meaning has to be ascertained having regard to the context in which it occurs. The relevant words are ""any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts."" The question is whether the said words contemplate only one form of provision namely reservation simplicitor, or do they take in other forms of special provisions like preferences, concessions and exemptions. In our opinion, reservation is the highest form of special provision, while preference, concession and exemption are lesser forms. The Constitutional scheme and context of Article 16(4) induces us to take the view that larger concept of reservations takes within its sweep all supplemental and ancilliary provisions as also lesser types of special provisions like exemptions, concessions and relaxations, consistent no doubt with the requirement of maintenance of efficiency of administration - the admonition of Article 335. The several concessions, exemptions and other measures issued by the Railway Administration and noticed in Karamchari Sangh are instances of supplementay, incidental and ancilliary provisions made with a view to make the main provision of reservation effective i.e., to ensure that the members of the reserved class fully avail of the provision for reservation in their favour. The other type of measure is the one in Thomas. There was no provision for reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion to the category of Upper Division Clerks. Certain tests were required to be passed before a Lower Division Clerk could be promoted as Upper Division Clerk. A large number of Lower Division Clerks belonging to S.C./S.T. were not able to pass those tests, with the result they were stagnating in the category of L.D.Cs. Rule 13AA was accordingly made empowering the government to grant exemption to members of S.C./S.T. from passing those tests and the Government did exempt them, not absolutely, but only for a limited period. This provision for exemption was a lesser form of special treatment than reservation. There is no reason why such a special provision should not be held to be included within the larger concept of reservation. It is in this context that the words ""any provision for the reservation of appointments and posts"" assume significance. The word ""any"" and the associated words must be given their due meaning. They are not a mere surplusage. It is true that in Thomas it was assumed by the majority that Clause (4) permits only one form of provision namely reservation of appointments/posts and that if any concessions or exemptions are to be extended to backward classes it can be done only under Clause (1) of Article 16. In fact the argument of the writ petitioners (who succeeded before the Kerala High Court) was that the only type of provision that the State can make in favour of the backward classes is reservation of appointments/posts provided by Clause (4) and that the said clause does not contemplate or permit granting of any exemptions or concessions to the backward classes. This argument was accepted by Kerala High Court. This Court, however, by a majority (Ray,C.J., Mathew, Krishna Iyer and Fazal Ali, JJ.) reversed the view taken by Kerala High Court, holding that such exemptions/concessions can be extended under Clause (1) of Article 16. Beg, J. who joined the majority in exemption provided by impugned notification was indeed a kind of reservation and was warranted by and relatable to Clause (4) of Article 16 itself. This was because - according to the learned Judge - Clause (4) was exhaustive of the provisions that can be made in favour of the backward classes in the matter of employment. We are inclined to agree with the view taken by Beg, J. for the reasons given hereinabove. In our opinion, therefore, where the State finds it necessary - for the purpose of giving full effect to the provision of reservation to provide certain exemptions, concessions or preferences to members of backward classes, it can extend the same under Clause (4) itself. In other words, all supplemental and ancilliary provisions to ensure full availment of provisions for reservation can be provided as part of concept of reservation itself. Similarly, in a given situation, the State may think that in the case of a particular backward class it is not necessary to provide reservation of appointments/posts and that it would be sufficient if a certain preference or a concession is provided in their favour. This can be done under Clause (4) itself. In this sense, Clause (4) of Article 16 is exhaustive of the special provisions that can be made in favour of ""the backward class of citizens"". Backward Classes having been classified by the Constitution itself as a class deserving special treatment and the Constitution having itself specified the nature of special treatment, it should be presumed that no further classification or special treatment is permissible in their favour apart from or outside of Clause (4) of Article 16.



64. Dr. Rajiv Dhawan, learned Counsel appearing for Srinarayana Dharama Paripalana Yogam (an association of Ezhavas in Kerala) submitted that Article 16(4) and 15(4) occupy different fields and serve different purposes. Whereas Article 15(4) contemplates positive action programmes, Article 16(4) enables the State to undertake schemes of positive discrimination. For this reason, the class of intended beneficiaries under both the clauses is different. The social and educational backwardness which is the basis of identifying backwardness
 under Article 15(4) is only partly true in the case of 'backward class of citizens' in Article 16(4). The expression ""any backward class of citizens"" occurring in Article 16(4) must be understood in the light of the purpose of the said clause namely, empowerment of those groups and classes which have been kept out of the administration - classes which have suffered historic disabilities
 arising from discrimination or disadvantage or both and who must now be provided entry into the administrative apparatus. In the light of the fact that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were also intended to be beneficiaries of Article 16(4) there is no reason why caste cannot be an exclusive criteria for determining beneficiaries under Article 16(4). Counsel emphasised the fact that Article 16(4) speaks of group protection and not individual protection.",

the Chief Justice for appropriate orders.""

		We are, therefore, called upon to resolve this issue here.   We 
have to lay down the law. We have to approach the question as a 
constitutional court should.

10.		In addition to the equality clause represented by Article 14 of 
the Constitution, Article 16 has specifically provided for equality of 
opportunity in matters of public employment.  Buttressing these fundamental 
rights, Article 309 provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution, 
Acts of the legislature may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service 
of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the 
affairs of the Union or of a State.  In view of the interpretation placed on 
Article 12 of the Constitution by this Court, obviously, these principles also 
govern the instrumentalities that come within the purview of Article 12 of 
the Constitution.  With a view to make the procedure for selection fair, the 
Constitution by Article 315 has also created a Public Service Commission 
for the Union and Public Service Commissions for the States.  Article 320 
deals with the functions of Public Service Commissions and mandates 
consultation with the Commission on all matters relating to methods of 
recruitment to civil services and for civil posts and other related matters.  As 
a part of the affirmative action recognized by Article 16 of the Constitution, 
Article 335 provides for special consideration in the matter of claims of the 
members of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for employment.  The 
States have made Acts, Rules or Regulations for implementing the above 
constitutional guarantees and any recruitment to the service in the State or in 
the Union is governed by such Acts, Rules and Regulations.  The 
Constitution does not envisage any employment outside this constitutional 
scheme and without following the requirements set down therein.  



30.		In Union Public Service Commission Vs. Girish Jayanti Lal 
Vaghela & Others [2006 (2) SCALE 115], this Court answered the 
question, who was a Government servant and stated:-

""Article 16 which finds place in Part III of the 
Constitution relating to fundamental rights provides that 
there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in 
matters relating to employment or appointment to any 
office under the State.  The main object of Article 16 is to 
create a constitutional right to equality of opportunity and 
employment in public offices.  The words ""employment"" 



32.		At this stage, it is relevant to notice two aspects.  In 
Kesavananda Bharati Vs. State of Kerala (1973 Supp. S.C.R. 1), this 
Court held that Article 14, and Article 16, which was described as a facet of 
Article 14, is part of the basic structure of the Constitution of India. The 
position emerging from Kesavananada Bharati (supra) was summed up by 
Jagannatha Rao, J., speaking for a Bench of three Judges in Indira Sawhney 
Vs. Union of India (1999 Suppl. (5) S.C.R. 229).  That decision also 
reiterated how neither the Parliament nor the Legislature could transgress the 
basic feature of the Constitution, namely, the principle of equality enshrined 
in Article 14 of which Article 16 (1) is a facet.  This Court stated, ""



39.		It was then contended that the rights of the employees thus 
appointed, under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution, are violated.  It is 
stated that the State has treated the employees unfairly by employing them 
on less than minimum wages and extracting work from them for a pretty 
long period in comparison with those directly recruited who are getting more 
wages or salaries for doing similar work.  The employees before us were 
engaged on daily wages in the concerned department on a wage that was 
made known to them.  There is no case that the wage agreed upon was not 
being paid.  Those who are working on daily wages formed a class by 
themselves, they cannot claim that they are discriminated as against those 
who have been regularly recruited on the basis of the relevant rules.  No 
right can be founded on an employment on daily wages to claim that such 
employee should be treated on a par with a regularly recruited candidate, and 
made permanent in employment, even assuming that the principle could be 
invoked for claiming equal wages for equal work.  There is no fundamental 
right in those who have been employed on daily wages or temporarily or on 
contractual basis, to claim that they have a right to be absorbed in service.  
As has been held by this Court, they cannot be said to be holders of a post, 
since, a regular appointment could be made only by making appointments 
consistent with the requirements of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.  
The right to be treated equally with the other employees employed on daily 
wages, cannot be extended to a claim for equal treatment with those who 
were regularly employed.  That would be treating unequals as equals.   It 
cannot also be relied on to claim a right to be absorbed in service even 
though they have never been selected in terms of the relevant recruitment 
rules.  The arguments based on Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution are 
therefore overruled.",

discrimination [Article 16(2)], special classification 
[Article 16(3)], affirmative action [Article 16(4)] which 
does not obliterate equality but which stands for 
classification within equality], and lastly, efficiency 
[Article 335].  As regards the words 'nothing in this 
article' in Article 16(4), it is urged that these words 
cannot wipe out Article 16(1) and, therefore, they have a 
limited meaning.  It is urged that the said words also 
occur in Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B).   It is urged that 
equality in the Constitution conceives the individual right 
to be treated fairly without discrimination in the matter 
of equality of opportunity.  It also conceives of affirmative 
action in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4). It enables 
classification as a basis for enabling preferences and 
benefits for specific beneficiary groups and that neither 
classification nor affirmative action can obliterate the 
individual right to equal opportunity.  Therefore, a 
balance has to be evolved to promote equal opportunities 
while protecting individual rights.  It is urged that as an 
individual right in Article 16(1), enforceability is provided 
for whereas ""group expectation"" in Article 16(4) is not a 
fundamental right but it is an enabling power which is 
not coupled with duty.  It is submitted that if the 
structural balance of equality in the light of the efficiency 
is disturbed and if the individual right is encroached 
upon by excessive support for group expectations, it 
would amount to reverse discrimination.



The question of extent of reservation is closely 
linked to the issue whether Article 16(4) is an exception 
to Article 16(1) or is Article 16(4) an application of Article
16(1).  If Article 16(4) is an exception to Article 16(1) then 
it needs to be given a limited application so as not to 
eclipse the general rule in Article 16(1). But if Article
16(4) is taken as an application of Article 16(1) then the 
two articles have to be harmonized keeping in view the 
interests of certain sections of the society as against the 
interest of the individual citizens of the society.



	At the outset, this Court stated that it was not 
concerned with the validity of constitutional amendments 
and, therefore, it proceeded on the assumption that 
Article 16(4A) is valid and is not unconstitutional.  
Basically, the question decided was whether the 'catch-
up' principle was tenable in the context of Article 16(4).  
It was held that the primary purpose of Article 16(4) and 
Article 16(4A) is to give due representation to certain 
classes in certain posts keeping in mind Articles 14, 16(1) 
and 335; that, Articles 14 and 16(1) have prescribed 
permissive limits to affirmative action by way of 
reservation under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the 
Constitution; that, Article 335 is incorporated so that 
efficiency of administration is not jeopardized and that 
Articles 14 and 16(1) are closely connected as they deal 
with individual rights of the persons.  They give a positive 
command to the State that there shall be equality of 
opportunity of all citizens in public employment.  It was 
further held that Article 16(1) flows from Article 14. It 
was held that the word 'employment' in Article 16(1) is 
wide enough to include promotions to posts at the stage 
of initial level of recruitment.  It was observed that Article
16(1) provides to every employee otherwise eligible for 
promotion fundamental right to be considered for 
promotion.  It was held that equal opportunity means the 
right to be considered for promotion.  The right to be 
considered for promotion was not a statutory right.  It 
was held that Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) did not confer any 
fundamental right to reservation.  That they are only 
enabling provisions.  Accordingly, in Ajit Singh (II)3, the 
judgment of this Court in Jagdish Lal20 case was 
overruled.  However, in the context of balancing of 
fundamental rights under Article 16(1) and the rights of 
reserved candidate under Articles 16(4) and 16(4A), this 
Court opined that Article 16(1) deals with a fundamental 
right whereas Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) are only enabling 
provisions and, therefore, the interests of the reserved 
classes must be balanced against the interests of other 
segments of society.  As a remedial measure, the Court 
held that in matters relating to affirmative action by the 
State, the rights under Articles 14 and 16 are required to 
be protected and a reasonable balance should be struck 
so that the affirmative action by the State does not lead 
to reverse discrimination.



vis-`-vis GC.  Therefore, in our view, equality as a 
concept is retained even under Article 16(4A) which is 
carved out of Article 16(4).

As stated above, Article 14 enables classification.  A 
classification must be founded on intelligible differential 
which distinguishes those that are grouped together from 
others.  The differential must have a rational relation to 
the object sought to be achieved by the law under 
challenge.  In Indra Sawhney5  an opinion was 
expressed by this Court vide para 802 that there is no 
constitutional or legal bar to making of classification.  
Article 16(4B) is also an enabling provision.  It seeks to 
make classification on the basis of the differential 
between current vacancies and carry-forward vacancies.  
In the case of Article 16(4B) we must keep in mind that 
following the judgment in R.K. Sabharwal8 the concept 
of post-based roster is introduced.  Consequently, 
specific slots for OBC, SC and ST as well as GC have to 
be maintained in the roster.  For want of candidate in a 
particular category the post may remain unfilled.   
Nonetheless, that slot has to be filled only by the 
specified category.  Therefore, by Article 16(4B) a 
classification is made between current vacancies on one 
hand and carry-forward/backlog vacancies on the other 
hand.  Article 16(4B) is a direct consequence of the 
judgment of this court in R.K. Sabharwal8 by which the 
concept of post-based roster is introduced.  Therefore, in 
our view Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B) form a composite 
part of the scheme envisaged.  Therefore, in our view 
Articles 16(4), 16(4A) and 16(4B) together form part of the 
same scheme.  As stated above, Articles 16(4A) and 
16(4B) are both inspired by observations of the Supreme 
Court in Indra Sawhney5 and R.K. Sabharwal8.  They 
have nexus with Articles 17 and 46 of the Constitution.  
Therefore, we uphold the classification envisaged by 
Articles 16(4A) and 16(4B).  The impugned constitutional 
amendments, therefore, do not obliterate equality.",

Section 17 of the Court-Fees Act provides that where a suit embraces two or more distinct subjects the plaint shall be chargeable with the aggregate amount of the fees to which the plain in suits embracing separately each of such subjects would be liable under the Act. Before discussing the question of the stamping of the plaint in respect of the transactions which the plaintiff challenges it is necessary to decide under which provision of the Act the plaint requires to be stamped in respect of the general relief for partition and delivery to the plaintiff of his share. The plaintiff's contention that Article 17-B of Schedule II applies here is contrary to the majority decision of the Full Bench of this Court (White, C.J., Krishnaswami Aiyar and Ayling, JJ.) in Rangiah Chetty v. Subramania Chetty (1910) 21 M.L.J. 21 (F.B.). It was there held by White, C.J. and Krishnaswami Aiyar, J., that a suit for partition of joint family property where the plaintiff is in joint possession with the other coparceners is governed by Section 7, Clause (iv)(b) and that therefore the plaint in such a suit should be stamped ad valorem on the amount at which the relief sought is valued Ayling, J., dissented and held that the case fell within Article 17(vi) of Schedule II which is now Article 17B of the Madras Court-Fees (Amendment) Act, 1922. The latter Act made extensive amendments in the Court-Fees Act of 1870 in certain other respects. The opinion of White, C.J. and Krishnaswami Aiyar, J., is not shared by any other Indian High Court. The Calcutta High Courthas applied Article 17(vi) of Schedule II. See Kirty Churn Miner v. Aunath Nath Deb (1882) I.L.R., Bidhata Roy v. Ram Charitra Roy (1907) 6 C.L.J. 651, Rajani Kanta Bag v. Rajabala Dasi (1924) I.L.R. 52 Cal. 128 and Nandalal Mukherjee v. Kalipada Mukherjee (1931) I.L.R. 59 Cal. 315, The Allahabad and the Lahore High Courts are of the same opinion. See Tar a Chand Mukherjee v. Afzal Beg (1911) I.L.R. 34 All. 184 and Asa Ram v. Jagan Nath (1934) I.L.R. 15 Lah. 531 (F.B.). The Bombay High Court has held that even where the plaintiff is in joint possession of the family property the provisions of Section 7 (v) should be applied. Balwant Ganesh v. Nana Chintamon (1893) I.L.R. 18 Bom. 209 and Dagdu v. Totaram (1909) I.L.R. 33 Bom. 658. It is true that in Motibhai v. Haridoss (1896) I.L.R. 22 Bom. 315, Section 7(iv)(b) was applied, but in Dagdu v. Totaram (1909) I.L.R. 33 Bom. 658, an attempt was made to distinguish the former decision and it cannot be regarded as representing the Bombay view. The question having been raised we must consider whether Rangiah Chetty v. Subramania Chettyi (1910) 21 M.L.J. 21 (F.B.), was correctly decided.



6. Section 7 (iv)(b) says that suits to enforce the right to share in any property on the ground that it is joint family property shall be stamped according to the amount at which the relief sought is valued in the plaint. The reasons for the majority view in Rangiah Chetti v. Subramania Chettyi (1910) 21 M.L.J. 21 (F.B.) are to be found in the judgment of Krishnaswami Aiyar, J., in which White, C.J., concurred. The reasons given by Krishnaswami Aiyar, J., can be shortly stated in this way. It would not be likely that the Legislature in enacting a measure with regard to court-fees would have omitted to make specific provision for such a common form of suit as a suit for partition by a member of a joint Hindu family and the Privy Council had applied a clause similarly worded in the Limitation Act of 1859 to such suits-The clause referred to in that Act is Clause 13 of Section 1, which fixed a period of twelve years for suits to enforce the right to share in any property movable or immovable on the ground that it is joint family property. Ayling, J., agreed with the opinion expressed in Dagdu v. Totaram (1909) I.L.R. 33 Bom. 658. that a suit to recover by partition a definite and ascertained share of a specified property could not fall under Section 7(iv)(b), but he did not accept the Bombay view that Section 7(v) was the appropriate section. He accepted the decision in Kirty Churn Mitter v. Aunath Nath Deb (1882) I.L.R. 8 Cal. 757, as embodying the correct view. In that case Garth, C.J., observed that it was impossible to say what would be the value to the plaintiff of the change in the nature of his property. A partition suit changes the form of enjoyment of the property. Instead of an undivided share the plaintiff claims a divided share. Ayling, J., agreed that it was impossible to estimate in money the value of such a suit. In this connection it may be mentioned that in Gill v. Varada Raghavayya (1919) 38 M.L.J. 92 : I.L.R. 43 Mad. 396, Wallis, C.J. and Sadasiva Aiyar, J., held that a suit for partition of immovable property by a person who alleged that he was in possession of it as co-tenant on behalf of himself and others was governed by Article 17(vi) of Schedule II (now Article 17B) because the value of the subject-matter was not capable of valuation.



23. As to the first question, it was conceded by the learned Judges of this Court whose decision prevailed in the Full Bench case Rangiah Chetty v. Subramania Chetty (1910) 21 M.L.J. 21 (F.B.), that the subject-matter in dispute which was nothing but a convenience sought by the plaintiff in the form of his enjoyment, was not capable of being estimated at a money value. They however declined to apply the provisions of Article 17(vi) to a suit of this nature as they found the second condition necessary for its application to be wanting. They felt that Section 7(iv)(b) in terms applied to a suit for partition even when the plaintiff claimed to be in joint possession of the family property and since the provision's of Article 17(vi) could not be attracted as long as a provision could be found in the Act for a suit of this kind, they held the above-stated article to be inapplicable. There is no doubt that if Section 7 (iv)(b) applied to a suit of this nature, Article 17(vi) would have no application. But the question is if Section 7 (iv)(b) is applicable. It reads as follows:



31. Section 7(iv)(b) and Section 7(v) have been found to be inapplicable. There is no other provision in the Court-Fees Act which would cover suits of this nature. If the convenience which the plaintiff desires in having his share partitioned is incapable of being estimated at a money value, as it undoubtedly is the only article applicable to a suit of this kind would be Article 17(vi) or Article 17(b) as enacted in Madras.

32. The second question presents no difficulty. If the plaintiff was not in possession, either actual or constructive, of the property at the time when he instituted the suit, the provisions contained in Section 7(v) of the Court-Fees Act would apply and he would have to pay court-fee in accordance with rules contained therein. Of course it is the allegation of the plaintiff himself which is material in this respect. But the plaintiff on his own showing was not in possession of some of the properties such as those which were sold or given under a usufructuary mortgage.",

Article 17,"Jai Singh And Anr. vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Ors. on 28 January, 1993",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1154876/?formInput=Article%2017,,"27. In the instant case, the Parliament found that 'atrocities' had instead of diminishing against the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were on increase. In order to check them and for the civil rights guaranteed, the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was passed.

28. This Act had been enacted under Article 17 of Constitution which reads as under:

""Article 17. Abolition of Untouchability --

""Untouchability"" is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. The enforcement of any disability arising out of ""untouchability"" shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law."" 



29. Article 17 places the word ""Untouchability"" in inverted commas; accordingly, the subject matter of the Article is not untouchability in its literal or grammatical sense but the practice as it has developed historically in India. (See Devarajiah v. Padmanna, AIR 1958 Mysore 84).

30. To prevent certain classes of Hindus who were once known as the ""Depressed Classes"" from entering a public temple was to practice Untouchability. (See P. S. Charya v. State of Madras, AIR 1956 Madras 541).

31. The Madras Temple Entry Authorising Act, 1947, as amended by the Madras Act (XIII of 1949) was held by the Madras High Court in AIR 1956 Mad 541 (supra) as not violative of any prohibition of the Constitution and it prohibited ""Untouchability"" in pursuance of a policy which was expressed in Article 17. The Act was covered by Article 35(a)(ii) and continued in force till repealed.



32. Article 17 is a very significant provision from the point of view of equality before the law. It guarantees social justice and dignity of man, the twin privileges which

were denied to a vast section of the Indian Society for centuries together. This Article does not define 'untouchability'. Parliament has passed a statute called The Untouchability Offences Act' (22 of 1955). The title of the Act was changed by Parliament by an Amendment Act in 1976. The Act was now called 'The Protection of Civil Rights Act'. The expression 'civil right' is defined as 'any right accruing to a person by reason of the abolition of untouchability by Article 17 of the Constitution'. This Act also does not attempt any definition of the word 'untouchability'. The absence of a definition of untouchability may give rise to some legal quibbling. The Oxford English Dictionary defines an 'untouchable' as a non caste Hindu whom caste men may not touch. As the word 'untouchable' is put in inverted commas, it is held that, the word is to be understood in its historical sense and not in literal and grammatical sense. (Devarajiah v. B. Pad-manna, AIR 1958 Mys 84). This Article fulfils at least 'in law' though not in fact, the dream of Gandhiji and other great social reformers who worked hard for the eradication of the social evil of untouchability. This Article is similar to the 13th Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America which abolished slavery and empowered the congress to enforce the abolition by appropriate means.



35. Article 17 of the Constitution was self-operating and if read with Article 35(a)(ii) irresistible conclusion follows that untouchability has been abolished and its practice in| any form is forbidden.

36. The present Act is a legislation falling within the field of the aforesaid provisions of the Constitution. It is self operating for anybody indulging in any of the activities committing offence which could be considered as untouchability would be liable to be punished.

37. Counsel appearing for the petitioners submitted that as Section 18 of the Act excludes the application of Section 438 Cr.P.C. in relation to any case involving the arrest of any person on an accusation of having committed an offence under this Act, it hits Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees the procedure to be followed in a trial of a criminal case to be fair, just and equal.",
Article 17,"Jagdish Pershad And Ors. vs Joti Pershad And Ors. on 16 December, 1974",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/37709/?formInput=Article%2017,,"(6) There is ample authority in support of the proposition that a suit for partition of alleged joint properties of which the plaintiff claims to be in actual or constructive possession is governed by the provision of Article 17(vi) of Schedule Ii of the Act and a fixed court-fee is payable on the plaint. The law in this respect cannot be said to be uncertain giving rise to any doubt as to whether the provisions of section 7(iv)(b) or Article 17(vi) of Schedule 11 are applicable in a suit such as the present one. Apart from the specific allegation made in the plain that the respondent was claiming separate possession by metes and bounds as a co-parcener, he in his statement stated that a portion of the house was let out to a tenant by their father. On the statement of the respondent the trial Court held that he was in symbolic possession of ""at least that portion of the house"" which is occupiea by the tenant.  



(9) In Rain Narain Kaul v. Mst. Bishan Rani and other's A. 1. R. 1938 Lahore 321 following Asa Rain's case (supra) it was held that in a suit for partition of properties alleged to be belonging to a joint family and being in joint possession of the parties, the court-fee payable on such a plaint was under Article 17 (vi) of Schedule Ii of the Act and not ad valorem on the share of the plaintiff in the properties in the suit.  

(10) Similar view was taken earlier by the Lahore High Court in Mst, Durga Devi v. Parbati, A.I.R. 1933 Lahore 208  

(11) Reference here may also be made to a Full Bench decision of the Lahore High Court in case Dewan Chand v. Dhani Ram and others, A.I.R. 1941 Lahore 123 The question that arose in that case related to the amount of court-fee payable on the memorandum of appeal against the preliminary decree in a suit for partition of alleged joint properties. The trial Court decreed the suit in respect of one property which was held to be jointly owned by the parties but dismissed the suit relating to other properties holding that they were not held jointly by the parties. The plaintiff in appeal paid the fixed court-fee as per Article 17(vi) of Schedule Ii of Act. On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the relief asked for in the appeal was not merely for change in the mode of enjoyment of the properties but to establish the appellant's title and possession of his alleged share in them and that such a relief was not incapable of being estimated in money and, therefore. Article 17 (vi) did not apply. Repelling the contention of the respondents it was held that the appeal arising from a suit for partition of the alleged joint properties of which the plaintiff claimed to be in actual or constructive possession, the fee payable thereon was the same as in the suit and that it was immaterial what the findings of the Court below were and whether the appeal was presented by the plaintiff or the defendant.  



(16) In Nikka and others v. Fazal Dad Khan and others, A.I.R. 1930 Lahore 839, a Division Bench of the Court held that where the plaintiff definitely alleges that he was in joint possession, the proper provision of the Act applicable to the case was Article 17(6) of Schedule Ii of the Act.  

(17) In the instant case the respondent had filed the suit as a co-paicener of the Joint Hindu Family property seeking a change in the mode of enjoyment, viz, instead of joint enjoyment of the family property, to enjoy his share separately therein. On his averment he is in constructive possession of the Joint Family property, viz, house in question. He being in possession of a part of the family property there is no merit in the contention advanced on behalf of the petilitiuners that the respondent should have separately valued his claim for share in the family jewellery and common family fund. On his claim the court-fee payable on the suit is the fixed court-fee as provided under Article 17(vi) of Schedule Ii of the Act. It is only when a person is out of possession of property to which he considers he was entitled on the strength of any right, title or interest that he claims in relation thereto and seeks to obtain possession thereof from the person who is keeping it bak from him that the suit is one for possession-bare and simple. In such a case there being no jointness of possession or title between the partics, the provisions of section 7(iv)(b) of the Act would apply, and not that of Article 17(vi) of Schedule Ii of the Act, (See Mt. Sat Bkawan v. Bedi Ram Kishan Smgh and. others, A.T.R. 1938 Lahore 275).  



(18) Before parting with this aspect of the matter case Santosh s|o Gopalci and another v. Rama s/o Ra""ho and others, Air 1949 Nagpur 305, may be noted, wherein it was observed that if the plaintiff is in joint possession of the whole estate, be that cither actual or constructive, only then Schedule It, Article 17 of the Act would be applicable.

(19) Although the consensus of the judicial opinion is that if the plaintiff alleges in the plaint that he is in possession of ail or any of the common properties while seeking partition of his share in the properties the suit has to be valued for the purposes of court-fee under the provisions of Article 17(vi) of Schedule Ii of the Act no reasons were assigned by the Nagpur High Court in the above-cited case for taking the view that the aforesaid Article was applicable only if the plaintiff was in joint possession of the whole of the estate involved in the suit.",

8.    We may also indicate that the Suits Valuation Act, 1887  in  terms  of
which the suits have to be valued for the purpose  of  Court  Fees  Act  has
also been amended vide U.P.  Act  7  of  1939  (w.e.f.  16.7.1939)  and  the
difference in both the Acts are given below:

9.    On comparing the above mentioned provisions, it is clear that  Article
17(iii) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act is applicable  in  cases  where
the  plaintiff  seeks  to  obtain   a   declaratory   decree   without   any
consequential relief and there is no  other  provision  under  the  Act  for
payment of fee relating to relief claimed.  Article 17(iii) of  Schedule  II
of the Court Fees Act makes it clear that  this  article  is  applicable  in
cases  where  plaintiff  seeks  to  obtain  a  declaratory  decree   without
consequential reliefs and there is no other  provision  under  the  Act  for
payment of fee relating to relief claimed.  If there is no  other  provision
under the Court Fees Act  in  case  of  a  suit  involving  cancellation  or
adjudging/declaring void or voidable a will or sale deed on the question  of
payment of court  fees,  then  Article 17(iii)  of  Schedule  II  shall  be
applicable.  But if such relief is covered by any other  provisions  of  the
Court Fees Act, then Article 17(iii) of Schedule II will not be  applicable.
On a comparison between the Court Fees Act and the U.P.  Amendment  Act,  it
is clear that Section 7(iv-A) of the U.P. Amendment Act covers suits for  or
involving cancellation or  adjudging/declaring  null  and  void  decree  for
money or an instrument securing money or other property having  such  value.
 The suit, in this case, was filed after the  death  of  the  testator  and,
therefore, the suit property covered by the will  has  also  to  be  valued.
Since Section 7(iv-A) of the U.P. Amendment Act specifically  provides  that
payment  of  court  fee  in  case  where  the  suit  is  for  or   involving
cancellation or adjudging/declaring null and void decree  for  money  or  an
instrument, Article 17(iii) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act  would  not
apply.  The U.P. Amendment Act, therefore,  is  applicable  in  the  present
case, despite the fact  that  no  consequential  relief  has  been  claimed.
Consequently, in terms of Section 7(iv-A) of the  U.P.  Amendment  Act,  the
court fees have to be commuted according to the value of the subject  matter
and the trial Court as well as the High Court have correctly held so.



11.   Plaintiff, in the instant case, valued the suit  at  Rs.30  Lakhs  for
the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction.   However, for the purpose  of  court
fee, the plaintiff paid a fixed court fee of Rs.200/- under Article 17(iii)
of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act.  Plaintiff had not  noticed  the  fact
that the above mentioned article stood amended by the State, by  adding  the
words “not otherwise provided by this Act”.  Since Section  7(iv-A)  of  the
U.P. Amended Act specifically provides for payment  of  court  fee  in  case
where the suit is for or involving cancellation or adjudging/declaring  void
or voidable an instrument securing  property  having  money  value,  Article
17(iii) of Schedule II of the Court Fees Act shall not be applicable.",

      only when the parties raise specific disputes in
      accordance with the procedures set out in the PPA.
      Admittedly, no dispute had been raised as per the
      procedure contemplated in Article 17 and 18 of the
      PPA. The Article 18 of the PPA provides that the


                                                Judgment in Appeal No 43 of 2011



             disputes raised in time could be settled through
             Disputes Resolution Forum. Admittedly without
             raising   any   dispute,    the    Committees             were
             constituted and their reports about Force Majeure
             event and quantum of damages were also accepted
             by the Electricity Board.



44. The above aspects would make it clear that the change of stand
    taken by the Appellant Board before the State Commission had
    taken place only after the State Commission was seized of the
    matter that too at the fag end of the proceedings i.e. on
    25.8.2010.

45. The Learned Counsel for the Appellant has raised the issue
    which pertains to the invocation of the provision of Article 18 of
    the PPA read with Section 86 (1) (f) of the Electricity Act. This
    contention is also misconceived. For invocation of the Article 18
    of the PPA, there must be a dispute. As mentioned earlier, no
    dispute had at any point of time been raised by the erstwhile
    Board during the long period of 4 years when the event of the
    Force Majeure was under consideration by the Board. During
    the said period, the Committees were constituted by the Board
    to consider the event of Force Majeure and to quantify the
    damages. In the absence of any dispute, no provision in the
    PPA would provide for referring the same for negotiation under
    Article 18. As mentioned above, the alleged dispute for the first
    time was raised before the State Commission only on 16.9.2010
    when already the proceedings were commenced before the
    State Commission which has seized of the matter relating to the
    Committee Reports. At that stage, taking a fresh decision by the
    Appellant on 25.8.2010 without even informing the Commission
    that too after the final arguments advanced by the Respondent
    before the State Commission on 31.7.2010 and after getting the

                                                 Judgment in Appeal No 43 of 2011



    adjournment for making their reply would not affect the
    proceedings pending before the State Commission. As there is a
    limitation for invoking Article 18, the belated disagreement
    cannot be adjudicated at the sweet will of the Appellant.



46. As indicated above, Article 17.3 (b) of the PPA, provides the
    condition under which Article 18 can be invoked. It reads as
    under:

             ""If the part in receipt of Force Majeure notice disputes
             the degree to which the Force Majeure event has
             affected the construction or operation of the project as
             the case may be, such dispute shall be settled as per
             Article 18""
47. The above condition had not been complied with. Admittedly, no
    dispute on receipt of the Force Majeure notice was raised by the
    Appellant and as such there was no occasion for invoking Article



    (b) had not been raised on the receipt of Force Majeure notice,
    there was no need to refer the matter for arbitration under article
 18. If at all any reference under article 18 was required to be
    made, then the Appellant who is a party raising the dispute
    should have initiated for arbitration. However, in the present
    case, the Electricity Board without raising the dispute and
    without initiating the process for Arbitration, set-up an internal
    Committee on 22.12.2006 comprising of its own senior level
    officers to ascertain the actual position and to report in regard to
    Force   Majeure    event.   Accordingly,   the     said     Committee
    conducted detailed inquiry and submitted its report on


                                                Judgment in Appeal No 43 of 2011



    21.7.2007. This report had been accepted by the Board on
    16.6.2008. Then the Assessing Committee was constituted. Its
    report also was accepted on 16.10.2009. Till then, at no point of
    time, the erstwhile Board refuted the said reports. Hence, the
    decision taken on 25.8.2010 by the Electricity Board recalling
    the earlier decision dated 16.6.2008 and 16.10.2009 to accept
    the Report of the Committees would not affect either the
    proceedings before the State Commission or the correctness of
    those Reports. Admittedly, the present Electricity Board had only
    recalled the earlier decision of the Electricity Board and not the
    reports of the Committees which are in accordance with the
    PPA.",
Article 18,"East And West Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Kamala Jayantilal Mehta on 13 February, 1956",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1561312/?formInput=Article%2018,,"The letter further says that in pursuance of these resolutions various notices were sent to the defendant and she was called upon to pay the amount. As she failed to comply with this requisition a suit was filed in the city Civil Court on 14-2-1951 which suit ultimately came to be dismissed by the learned Judge. 

 3. Turning to the Articles of Association which constitute the contract between the company and the shareholders and according to which a call can be made and the liability for the call can be imposed upon a shareholder, the two material articles are Articles 18 and 19. Article 18 provides: 



 But as the argument was advanced to us with regard to the power of delegation of the directors, which we shall examine later, it is necessary to look at Articles 18 and 19 on the assumption that the directors could delegate their power vested in them under Article 18.

 Article 19 when read with Article 18 makes it clear that whatever power of delegation the directors may have generally, as far as the making of the call is concerned, a call can only be made by a resolution of the directors because Article 19 fixes the time when the call is deemed to be made and the time fixed is when the resolution of the directors authorises the call. Therefore it is clear that Article 19 contemplates and Indeed requires the making of the call by a resolution passed by the directors at a meeting of the board of directors. 



 If it is not necessary to fix the person to whom and the place at which payment is to be made by a resolution, it is equally not necessary to fix the time of payment. The fallacy underlying this argument is that although the second part of Article 18 mentions all these factors, it does not, as already pointed out, indicate how these factors should be appointed by the directors. 

 It may be by a resolution or it may not be, the second part of Article 18 is silent. Therefore, if any of these factors are essential for the making of a call, then by reason of Article 19 that factor must form part of a valid resolution making the call. 



 We might also look at the provision with regard to the call being made payable by instalments. This provision appears at the end of Article 18 after Article 18 has dealt with the authority of directors to make the call and the conditions imposing the liability upon the shareholder, and in our opinion this provision relates to the making of the call and therefore it must form part of the resolution authorising the call. 

 This again is a matter of substance. Whether a call should be paid in one sum or by instalments goes to the question of the liability of the shareholder, and therefore this provision is as much of substance as the provision with regard to the fixing of time for the payment of the call.",
Article 18,"Balaji Raghavan/S.P.Anand vs Union Of India on 15 December, 1995",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1882300/?formInput=Article%2018,,"13.  The learned  Attorney General  for India  prefaced	 his
arguments on  behalf of	 the Union  of India by stating that
almost every  country in  the world,  including	 those	with
republican and socialist constitutions, follows the practice
of conferring  awards for  meritorious services	 rendered by
its citizens.  The  learned  counsel  then  referred  us  to
several dictionaries  for the  meanings of ""Title"", ""Award"",
""Distinction"", ""Decoration""  and  ""Order"".  He	then  stated
that, according	 to the	 ordinary and  contextual meaning in
Article 18,  the word ""title"" means a title of honour, rank,
function  or   office  in   which  there  is  a	 distinctive
appellation. An	 appellation, according to him, is a name or
title by  which a person is called or known, something which
is  normally   prefixed	 or   suffixed,	 for  example,	Sir,
K.C.I.E., Maharaja,  Nawab, Dewan  Bahadur, etc. The learned
counsel submitted  that it is these appellations that appear
as prefixes  or suffixes  which are sought to be interdicted
by Article 18(1). Since  the National Awards are not titles
of nobility  and are not to be used as suffixes or prefixes,
they are  not prohibited  by Article 18. In this regard, we
were referred  to the Press Note dated April 17, 1968 issued
by the	Government of  India. The  learned  counsel  further
submitted that	the words  ""not being a military or academic
distinction"" in	 Article 18  have  been	 used  ex  abundanti
cautela. Since	military and academic distinctions, such as,
General, Colonel,  Professor, Mahavir  Chakra, B.A., etc. do
carry suffixes or prefixes, the framers of the Constitution,
by way	of abundant  caution, expressly	 mentioned that they
would be exempted. It follows that distinctions which do not
carry suffixes	or prefixes  will not  be  affected  by	 the
interdiction in	 Article 18(1).	 At this  stage, the learned
counsel	 took	us  through   the  relevant   parts  of	 the
discussions in	the Constituent	 Assembly that	led  to	 the
framing of Article 18(1) to support the aforesaid stance.



16.  We may  now address  the central  issue in the case. At
the outset,  we may  point out	that the marginal heading of
Article 18,  which reads  as ""Abolition	 of  Titles""  is  an
incorrect summarization	 of its contents as it does not seek
to abolish  titles granted  in the  past. Sir Ivor Jennings,
the noted constitutional lawyer, has described Article 18 as
""not a	right at  all, but  a restriction  on executive	 and
legislative power.""
17.  From the  aforementioned discussion,  two views  on the
proper interpretation of Article 18(1) emerge:-



19.  The provision  that is now Article 18 (1) was discussed
and formulated	in the	report of  the Advisory Committee on
Fundamental Rights.  This Committee had, in view of its wide
agenda, appointed  two Sub-Committees,	one  on	 Fundamental
Rights and the other on Minorities. The former Sub-Committee
was chaired  by Acharya	 J.B. Kripalani.  On March 25, 1947,
the present  Article 18(1)  was discussed for the first time
in the	Sub-Committee on  Fundamental Rights. The agenda for
the meeting  was the  discussion of the note prepared by Mr.
K.T. Shah on Fundamental Rights which contained five clauses
relating to  the prohibition  of, and  restrictions on,	 the
conferment and	acceptance of  titles, honours, distinctions
and privileges. Clause 3 of this note read:-



32.  It has  been contended  before us	that over the years,
the purpose  for which these awards were instituted has been
diluted and  they are  granted liberally  to persons who are
undeserving of	them. The  perversion of  the system was the
motivating factor  behind the  Bill introduced in Parliament
by Acharya  Kripalani to abolish these decorations. It is to
be remembered that Acharya Kripalani was the Chairman of the
Sub-Committee  on   Fundamental	 Rights	 where	the  present
Article 18(1)  was originally formulated. He was, therefore,
fully aware  of the  exact import  of Article 18(1). It  is
significant that in the debates in Parliament, the thrust of
his attack  was on the misuse of these decorations. However,
it is axiomatic that the misuse of a concept does not change
its inherent  nature. The  National Awards  do not amount to
""titles"" within the meaning of Article 18(1) and they should
not be	used as	 suffixes or  prefixes. If this is done, the
defaulter should forfeit the National Award conferred on him
or her by following the procedure laid down in Regulation 10
of each	 of the	 four notifications  creating these National
Awards.",
Article 18,"Dr.Meera Thinakaran vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 14 March, 2012",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/9728631/?formInput=Article%2018,,"3. According to the petitioner, the said Sale Certificate  was forwarded to the third respondent for filing the same as  required under Section 89 of the Registration Act. Strangely,  along with the Sale Certificate, the Recovery Officer forwarded a Deed of sale also.  Admittedly, the Sale Certificate was levied with stamp duty as provided in Article 18(c) of the Indian Stamp Act.  Thereafter,  the third respondent,  who is vested with the powers of Collector, as per the Indian Stamps Act,   impounded  the said document by his proceedings in impounding No.1 of 2002 and kept the document without registration. He demanded stamp duty  as per Article 23 of the  Indian Stamp Act and surcharge under Section 116-A of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act.  The petitioner submitted an objection for the same in his letter dated 05.08.2002. In the said letter, the petitioner had informed the third respondent that he had rightly paid the stamp duty at 8% as per Article 18(c) of the Indian Stamp Act as the document is  only a  Sale Certificate and not a Sale Deed. He further contended that  except the stamp duty, no other amount,  such as surcharge,  could be levied.  



	    7. Before going into the factual aspects of the case, let us consider the legal issues involved. Undoubtedly, a Certificate of Sale granted to the purchaser of any property held by public auction by a Civil or Revenue Court or Collector or Revenue Officer, is liable to be charged with duty under Article 18 of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. If it is a conveyance (Sale Deed) it is chargeable with stamp duty as per Article 23 of the Indian Stamp Act. As per Section 116 (A) of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act, surcharge is leviable on the duty imposed by the Indian Stamp Act on every sale of immovable property. The method of assessment of surcharge is also provided in Section 116(A) of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act. A perusal of the said provision would go to show that specifically, there is no mention about the Sale Certificate in respect of immovable property sold by public auction by a Civil or Revenue Court or Collector or other Revenue Officer.



	11. But,  the learned Advocate General appearing for respondents would contend that a Sale Certificate issued by the Recovery Officer under the ""Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993"" does not fall within the ambit of Article 18 of the Indian Stamp Act. According to him, the Recovery Officer under the above said Act is neither a Collector nor a Revenue Officer as envisaged under Article 18 of the Indian Stamps Act. Therefore, according to him, the Sale Certificate issued by him conveys title to the purchaser and thus, it is an instrument of Sale falling within the ambit of Article 23 of the Indian Stamp Act and so it is liable for surcharge under Section 116-A of the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act.



	20. Now, coming to the next contention of the leaned counsel that the Recovery Officer appointed under the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act cannot be construed as a Revenue Officer as contemplated in Article 18 of the Indian Stamps Act needs to be considered. A similar question arose before a Division Bench of this Court as to whether the Sale Certificate issued by the Recovery Officer under the SARFAESI Act will fall within the ambit of Article 18 of the Indian Stamps Act. The Division Bench in K.Chidambara Manickam VS Shakeena and Ors reported in A.I.R.2008 Madras 108 has clearly held that such a Sale Certificate issued by the Recovery Officer under SARFAESI Act would squarely fall within the ambit of Article 18 of the Indian Stamps Act. In view of the said law laid down by the Division Bench, the argument of the learned Advocate General deserves only to be rejected. Thus, I hold that the Recovery Officer under Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act will fall within the meaning  of a Revenue Officer as enumerated under Article 18 of the Indian Stamp Act.  Thus  a Certificate of Sale issued by him will squarely fall within the said provision.",
Article 18,"Balaji Raghavan S.P. Anand vs Union Of India on 15 December, 1995",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/171223892/?formInput=Article%2018,,"13. The learned Attorney General for India prefaced his arguments on behalf

Liberty' means liberty relating to or concerning the person or

body of the individual and it is, in this sense, antithesis of

physical restraint or coercion.      `Personal Liberty' means a

personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment, arrest or

other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of

legal justification. This negative right constitutes the essence of

personal liberty. Patanjali Shastri, J. however, said that whatever

may be the generally accepted connotation of the expression

`personal liberty', it was used in Article 21 in a sense which

excludes the freedom dealt with in Article 19.    Thus, the Court

gave a narrow interpretation to `personal liberty'. This court

excluded certain varieties of rights, as separately mentioned in

Article 19, from the purview of `personal liberty' guaranteed by

Art. 21.




64.   In Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Others AIR 1963

SC 1295, Subba Rao, J. defined `personal liberty, as a right of an

individual to be free from restrictions or encroachment on his

person whether these are directly imposed or indirectly brought

about by calculated measure.      The court held that `personal

liberty' in Article 21 includes all varieties of freedoms except

those included in Article 19.


65.   In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Another (1978)

1 SCC 248, this court expanded the scope of the expression

`personal liberty' as used in Article 21 of the Constitution of

India.     The court rejected the argument that the expression

`personal liberty' must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping

between Article 21 and Article 19(1).    It was observed:    ""The

expression `personal liberty' in Article 21 is of the widest

amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute

the personal liberty of a man and some of them have been raised

to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional

protection under Article 19."" So, the phrase `personal liberty' is


very wide and includes all possible rights which go to constitute

personal liberty, including those which are mentioned in Article




68.     While examining the ambit, scope and content of the

expression ""personal liberty"" in the said case, it was held that

the term is used in this Article as a compendious term to include

within itself all varieties of rights which goes to make up the

""personal liberties"" or man other than those dealt within several

clauses of Article 19(1). While Article 19(1) deals with particular


species or attributes of that freedom, ""personal liberty"" in Article

21 takes on and comprises the residue.



74.   In Prem Shankar Shukla v. Delhi Administration (1980)

3 SCC 526, this court has made following observations:
      ""....... The Punjab Police Manual, in so far as it puts
      the ordinary Indian beneath the better class breed
      (para 26.21A and 26.22 of Chapter XXVI) is
      untenable and arbitrary. Indian humans shall not
      be dichotomised and the common run discriminated
      against regarding handcuffs. The provisions in para
      26.22 that every under-trial who is accused of a
      non-bailable offence punishable with more than 3
      years prison term shall be routinely handcuffed is
      violative of Articles 14, 19 and 21. The nature of the
      accusation is not the criterion. The clear and
      present danger of escape breaking out of the police
      control is the determinant. And for this there must
      be clear material, not glib assumption, record of
      reasons and judicial oversight and summary
      hearing and direction by the court where the victim
      is produced. ... Handcuffs are not summary
      punishment vicariously imposed at police level, at


once obnoxious and irreversible. Armed escorts,
worth the salt, can overpower any unarmed under-
trial and extra guards can make up exceptional
needs. In very special situations, the application of
irons is not ruled out. The same reasoning applies
to (e) and (f). Why torture the prisoner because
others will demonstrate or attempt his rescue? The
plain law of under-trial custody is thus contrary to
the unedifying escort practice. (Para 31)

Even in cases where, in extreme circumstances,
handcuffs have to be put on the prisoner, the
escorting authority must record contemporaneously
the reason for doing so. Otherwise, under Article 21
the procedure will be unfair and bad in law. The
minions of the police establishment must make
good their security recipes by getting judicial
approval. And, once the court directs that handcuffs
shall be off, no escorting authority can overrule
judicial direction. This is implicit in Article 21 which
insists upon fairness, reasonableness and justice in
the very procedure which authorities stringent
deprivation of life and liberty. (Para 30)

It is implicit in Articles 14 and 19 that when there is
no compulsive need to fetter a person's limbs, it is
sadistic, capricious, despotic and demoralizing to
humble a man by manacling him. Such arbitrary
conduct surely slaps Article 14 on the face. The
minimal freedom of movement which even a
detainee is entitled to under Article 19 cannot be
cut down cruelly by application of handcuffs or
other hoops. It will be unreasonable so to do unless
the State is able to make out that no other practical
way of forbidding escape is available, the prisoner
being so dangerous and desperate and the
circumstances so hostile to safekeeping. (Para 23)

Whether handcuffs or other restraint should be
imposed on a prisoner is a matter for the decision of
the authority responsible for his custody. But there
is room for imposing supervisory regime over the


      exercise of that power. One sector of supervisory
      jurisdiction could appropriately lie with the court
      trying the accused, and it would be desirable for the
      custodial authority to inform that court of the
      circumstances in which, and the justification for,
      imposing a restraint on the body of the accused. It
      should be for the court concerned to work out the
      modalities of the procedure requisite for the
      purpose of enforcing such control.""",

15. In an early judgment of this Court, M.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish

   Chandra 1954 SCR 1077, an eight-Judge Bench of this Court set out

   Article 20(3), and then went into the historical origin of this Article in

   English law. In an important passage, the Court held:
         “In view of the above background, there is no inherent
         reason to construe the ambit of this fundamental right as
         comprising a very wide range. Nor would it be legitimate
         to confine it to the barely literal meaning of the words
         used, since it is a recognised doctrine that when
         appropriate a constitutional provision has to be liberally
         construed, so as to advance the intendment thereof and


to prevent its circumvention. Analysing the terms in which
this right has been declared in our Constitution, it may be
said to consist of the following components. (1) It is a right
pertaining to a person “accused of an offence”; (2) It is a
protection against “compulsion to be a witness”; and (3) It
is a protection against such compulsion resulting in his
giving evidence “against himself”.”
                                            (at page 1086)

Broadly stated the guarantee in Article 20(3) is against
“testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is
confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial
for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can
see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional
guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would
be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to
miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain
American decisions. The phrase used in Article 20(3) is
“to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely
by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents
or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb
witness (See Section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the like.
“To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish
evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through
the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in
other modes. So far as production of documents is
concerned, no doubt Section 139 of the Evidence Act
says that a person producing a document on summons is
not a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the
right of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the
connotation of the word “witness”, which must be
understood in its natural sense i.e. as referring to a
person who furnishes evidence. Indeed, every positive
volitional act, which furnishes evidence is testimony, and
testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures
the positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as
opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission
on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the
protection in respect of the evidence so procured is
confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.
The phrase used in Article 20(3) is “to be a witness” and
not to “appear as a witness”: It follows that the protection


         afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the
         phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of
         testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well
         extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from
         him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a
         formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence
         has been levelled which in the normal course may result
         in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in
         other situations does not call for decision in this case.
         Considered in this light, the guarantee under Article 20(3)
         would be available in the present cases to these
         petitioners against whom a first information report has
         been recorded as accused therein. It would extend to any
         compulsory     process       for production of   evidentiary
         documents which are reasonably likely to support a
         prosecution against them.



 20. We now come to the judgment of this Court in Nandini Satpathy v. P.L.

   Dani (1978) 2 SCC 424. This case referred to the inter-play between

   Article 20(3) and section 161 of the CrPC as follows:
        “21. Back to the constitutional quintessence invigorating
        the ban on self-incrimination. The area covered by Article
20(3) and Section 161(2) is substantially the same. So
        much so, we are inclined to the view, terminological
        expansion apart, that Section 161(2) of the CrPC is a
        parliamentary gloss on the constitutional clause. The
        learned Advocate-General argued that Article 20(3), unlike
        Section 161(1), did not operate at the anterior stages
        before the case came to court and the accused's
        incriminating utterance, previously recorded, was
        attempted to be introduced. He relied on some passages
        in American decisions but, in our understanding, those
        passages do not so circumscribe and, on the other hand,
        the landmark Miranda [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 US 436
        (1966)] ruling did extend the embargo to police
        investigation also. Moreover, Article 20(3), which is our
        provision, warrants no such truncation. Such a narrow
        meaning may emasculate a necessary protection. There
        are only two primary queries involved in this clause that
        seals the lips into permissible silence: (i) Is the person
        called upon to testify “accused of any offence”? (ii) Is he
        being compelled to be witness against himself? A
        constitutional provision receives its full semantic range
        and so it follows that a wider connotation must be
        imparted to the expressions “accused of any offence” and
        “to be witness against himself”. The learned Advocate-



        General, influenced by American decisions rightly agreed
        that in expression Section 161(2) of the Code might cover
        not merely accusations already registered in police
        stations but those which are likely to be the basis for
        exposing a person to a criminal charge. Indeed, this wider
        construction, if applicable to Article 20(3), approximates
        the constitutional clause to the explicit statement of the
        prohibition in Section 161(2). This latter provision
        meaningfully uses the expression “expose himself to a
        criminal charge”. Obviously, these words mean, not only
        cases where the person is already exposed to a criminal


charge but also instances which will imminently expose
him to criminal charges. In Article 20(3), the expression
“accused of any offence” must mean formally accused in
praesenti not in futuro — not even imminently as
decisions now stand. The expression “to be witness
against himself” means more than the court process. Any
giving of evidence, any furnishing of information, if likely to
have an incriminating impact, answers the description of
being witness against oneself. Not being limited to the
forensic stage by express words in Article 20(3), we have
to construe the expression to apply to every stage where
furnishing of information and collection of materials takes
place. That is to say, even the investigation at the police
level is embraced by Article 20(3). This is precisely what
Section 161(2) means. That sub-section relates to oral
examination by police officers and grants immunity at that
stage. Briefly, the Constitution and the Code are co-
terminus in the protective area. While the Code may be
changed, the Constitution is more enduring. Therefore, we
have to base our conclusion not merely upon Section
161(2) but on the more fundamental protection, although
equal in ambit, contained in Article 20(3).



23. Sahai, J. in a separate opinion, concurring in part, but dissenting on the

   constitutional validity of section 15, referred to Article 20(3) as follows:

         “456. A confession is an admission of guilt. The person
         making it states something against himself, therefore it
         should be made in surroundings which are free from
         suspicion. Otherwise it violates the constitutional
         guarantee under Article 20(3) that no person accused of
         an offence shall be compelled to be a witness against
         himself. The word ‘offence’ used in the article should be
         given its ordinary meaning. It applies as much to an
         offence committed under TADA as under any other Act.
         The word, ‘compelled’ ordinarily means ‘by force’. This
         may take place positively and negatively. When one
         forces one to act in a manner desired by him it is
         compelling him to do that thing. Same may take place
         when one is prevented from doing a particular thing
         unless he agrees to do as desired. In either case it is
         compulsion. A confession made by an accused or
         obtained by him under coercion suffers from infirmity
         unless it is made freely and voluntarily. No civilised
         democratic country has accepted confession made by an
         accused before a police officer as voluntary and above
         suspicion, therefore, admissible in evidence. One of the
         established rule or norms accepted everywhere is that
         custodial confession is presumed to be tainted. The mere


         fact that the Legislature was competent to make the law,
         as the offence under TADA is one which did not fall in any
         State entry, did not mean that the Legislature was
         empowered to curtail or erode a person of his
         fundamental rights. Making a provision which has the
         effect of forcing a person to admit his guilt amounts to
         denial of the liberty. The class of offences dealt by TADA
         may be different than other offences but the offender
         under TADA is as much entitled to protection of Articles 20
         and 21 as any other. The difference in nature of offence or
         the legislative competence to enact a law did not affect
         the fundamental rights guaranteed by Chapter III. If the
         construction as suggested by the learned Additional
         Solicitor General is accepted it shall result in taking the
         law back once again to the days of Gopalan [A.K.
         Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 27] . Section 15
         cannot be held to be valid merely because it is as a result
         of law made by a body which has been found entitled to
         make the law. The law must still be fair and just as held by
         this Court. A law which entitles a police officer to record
         confession and makes it admissible is thus violative of
         both Articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution.”",
Article 20,"Rao Shiv Bahadur Singh And Another vs The State Of Vindhya Pradesh on 22 May, 1953",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1786180/?formInput=Article%2020,,"Article 20(1) of the Constitution is as follows:
     ""No person shall be convicted of any offence except for
violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of
the act charged as an offence, nor be subjected to a penalty
greater than that which might have been inflicted under	 the
law in force at the time of the commission of the offence.""
   This	 article  in its broad import has  been	 enacted  to
prohibit convictions and sentences under expost facto  laws.
The  principle	underlying such prohibition  has  been	very
elaborately  discussed and pointed out in the  very  learned
judgment  of  Justice  Willes  in the  well  known  case  of
Phillips  v. Eyre(1) and also by the Supreme Court of V.  S.
A.  in	calder	v.  Bull (2).  In the  English	case  it  is
explained that ex post facto laws are laws which voided	 and
punished  what had been lawful when done.  There can  be  no
doubt  as to the paramount importance of the principle	that
such  ex  Post	facto  laws,  which  retrospectively  create
offences and punish them are bad as being highly inequitable
and   unjust.	In  the	 English  system  of   jurisprudence
repugnance of such laws to universal notions of fairness and
justice is treated as a ground not for invalidating the	 law
itself	but as compelling a beneficent construction  thereof
where  the language of the statute by any means permits	 it.
In the American system, however, such ex post facto laws are
themselves rendered invalid by virtue of article 1, sections
9  and	10  of its Constitution.  It  is  contended  by	 the
learned Attoney-General that article 20 of' the Constitution
(1)  (1870) 6 Q.B.D. i, at 23,and 25.



This  contention, however, cannot be upheld.  On  a  careful
consideration  of the respective articles, one is struck  by
the  marked  difference in language used in the	 Indian	 and
American  Constitutions.  Sections 9(3) and 10 of article  I
of  the	 American Constitution merely say that ""No  ex	post
facto  law shall be passed..."" and "" No State shall pass  ex
Post  facto  law......	But  in article 20  of	 the  Indian
Constitution  the language used is in much wider terms,	 and
what  is  prohibited is the conviction of a  person  or	 his
subjection  to	a  penalty under ex post  facto	 laws.	 The
prohibition under the article is not confined to the passing
or the validity of the law, but extends to the conviction or
the  sentence  and is based on its character as an  ex	post
facto  law.  The fullest effect must therefore be  given  to
the  actual  words  used in the article.  Nor  does  such  a
construction  of article 20 result in  giving  retrospective
operation to the fundamental right thereby recognised.	 All
that  it  amounts  to is that the future  operation  of	 the
fundamental right declared in article 20 may also in certain
cases
 (1) [1951] S.C.R. 228.



1200
result from acts and situations which had their commencement
in  the pre-Constitution period.  In The Queen v.  St.	Mary
Whitechapel (1) Lord, Denman C.J. pointed out that a statute
which in its direct operation is prospective cannot properly
be  called  a retrospective statute because a  part  of	 the
requisites for its action is drawn from a time antecedent to
its  passing.	The lgeneral principle	therefore  that	 the
fundamental rights have no retrospective operation is not in
any way affected by giving the fullest effect to the wording
of  article 20.	 This article must accordingly be  taken  to
prohibit all convictions or subjections to penalty after the
Constitution  in respect of ex post facto laws	whether	 the
same  was a post-Constitution law or apre Constitution	law.
That  such  is the intended of the wording used	 in  article
20(1)  is confirmed by the similar wording used in  articles
20  (2) and 20 (3).  Under article 20 (2) for  instance,  it
cannot	be reasonably urged that the prohibition  of  double
jeopardy  applies  only when both the  occasions  there	 for
arise  after the Constitution.	Similarly. under article 20
(3) it cannot be suggested that a person accused before	 the
Constitution  can  be  compelled to  be	 a  witness  against
himself, if after the Constitution the case is pending.
In  this  context  it is necessary to notice  that  what  is
prohibited  under article 20 is only conviction or  sentence
under an ex post facto law and not the trial thereof.	Such
trial under a procedure different from what obtained at	 the
time  of  the  commission  of the  offence  or	by  a  court
different from that which had competence at the time  cannot
ipso  facto  be	 held to  be.  unconstitutional.   A  person
accused	 of the commission of an offence has no	 fundamental
right  to  trial by a particular court or  by  a  particular
procedure, except in so far as any constitutional  objection
by  way	 of  discrimination or the violation  of  any  other
fundamental right may be involved.



referred  to  therein must be taken to relate not to  a	 law
""deemed"" to be in force and thus brought into force, but the
law factually in operation at the time or what may be called
the  then  existing law.  Otherwise, it is  clear  that	 the
whole purpose of article 20 would be completely defeated  in
its application even to ex post facto laws passed after	 the
Constitution.	Every  such ex post facto law  can  be	made
retrospective,	as  it must be, if it is  to  regulate	acts
committed  before the actual passing of the Act, and it	 can
well  be  urged	 that by  such	retrospective  operation  it
becomes the law in force at. the time of the commencement of
the  Act.   It	is obvious that such  a	 construction  which
nullifies article 20 cannot possibly be adopted.  It  cannot
therefore be doubted that the phrase ""law in force"" as	used
in  article 20 must be understood in its natural  sense  as
being  the law in fact in existence and in operation at	 the
time  of the commission of the offence as distinct from	 the
law ""deemed"" to have become operative by virtue of the power
of legislature to pass retrospective laws.  It follows	that
if the appellants are able to substantiate their  contention
that  the acts charged as offences in this case have  become
such  only by virtue, of Ordinance No. XLVIII of 1949  which
has  admittedly	 been passed subsequent	 to  the  commission
thereof,  then	they  would be entitled to  the	 benefit  of
article 20 of
12O2
the  Constitution and to have their convictions set  ,aside.
This  leads to an examination of the  relevant	pre-existing
law.",

made an organized attempt to embezzle its funds and to conceal the true state of its

affairs from the share-holders and on the allegation that the company had indulged in

fraudulent transactions and falsified its records. Offences were registered and search

question which this Court addressed was whether there was a contravention of Article

administration of these tests are within the scope of a testimonial, attracting the

protective shield of Article 20(3) of the Constitution. Chief Justice Balakrishnan

adverted to the earlier decisions rendered in the context of privacy and noted that thus

far, judicial understanding had stressed mostly on the protection of the body and

physical actions induced by the state. The Court emphasised that while the right

against self-incrimination is a component of personal liberty under Article 21, privacy

under the constitution has a meeting point with Article 20(3) as well. In the view of

the Court:




 “The theory of interrelationship of rights mandates that the right
                   against self-incrimination should also be read as a component of
                   “personal liberty” under Article 21. Hence, our understanding of the
                   “right to privacy” should account for its intersection with Article
20(3). Furthermore, the “rule against involuntary confessions” as
                   embodied in Sections 24, 25, 26 and 27 of the Evidence Act, 1872
                   seeks to serve both the objectives of reliability as well as
                   voluntariness of testimony given in a custodial setting. A conjunctive
                   reading of Articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution along with the
                   principles of evidence law leads us to a clear answer. We must
                   recognise the importance of personal autonomy in aspects such as
                   the choice between remaining silent and speaking. An individual's
                   decision to make a statement is the product of a private choice and
                   there should be no scope for any other individual to interfere with
                   such autonomy, especially in circumstances where the person
                   faces exposure to criminal charges or penalties…

                   Therefore, it is our considered opinion that subjecting a person to
                   the impugned techniques in an involuntary manner violates the
                   prescribed boundaries of privacy. Forcible interference with a
                   person's mental processes is not provided for under any statute and
                   it most certainly comes into conflict with the “right against self-
                   incrimination”.”125

In tracing the right to privacy under Article 20(3), as well as Article 21, the decision

marks a definite shift away from the M P Sharma rationale. The right not to be

compelled to speak or to incriminate oneself when accused of an offence is an

embodiment of the right to privacy. Selvi indicates how the right to privacy can

straddle the ambit of several constitutional rights - in that case, Articles 20(3) and 21.






88         M P Sharma dealt with a challenge to a search on the ground that the statutory

provision which authorized it, violated the guarantee against self-incrimination in

Article 20(3). In the absence of a specific provision like the Fourth Amendment to the

US Constitution in the Indian Constitution, the Court answered the challenge by its

ruling that an individual who is subject to a search during the course of which material

is seized does not make a voluntary testimonial statement of the nature that would

attract Article 20(3). The Court distinguished a compulsory search from a voluntary

statement of disclosure in pursuance of a notice issued by an authority to produce

documents. It was the former category that was held to be involved in a compulsive

search, which the Court held would not attract the guarantee against self-

incrimination. The judgment, however, proceeded further to hold that in the absence

of the right to privacy having been enumerated in the Constitution, a provision like the

Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution could not be read into our own. The

observation in regard to the absence of the right to privacy in our Constitution was

strictly speaking, not necessary for the decision of the Court in M P Sharma and the

observation itself is no more than a passing observation. Moreover, the decision does

not adjudicate upon whether privacy could be a constitutionally protected right under

any other provision such as Article 21 or under Article 19.




89     Kharak Singh does not contain a reference to M P Sharma. The decision of

the majority in Kharak Singh is essentially divided into two parts; the first dealing with

the validity of a regulation for nocturnal domiciliary visits (which was struck down) and

the second dealing with the rest of the regulation (which was upheld). The decision

on the first part, which dealt with Regulation 236(b) conveys an inescapable

impression that the regulation invaded the sanctity of the home and was a violation of

ordered liberty. Though the reasoning of the Court does not use the expression

‘privacy’, it alludes to the decision of the US Supreme Court in Wolf v Colorado, which

deals with privacy. Besides, the portion extracted in the judgment has a reference to

privacy specifically at two places. While holding domiciliary visits at night to be invalid,

the Court drew sustenance from the right to life under Article 21 which means



                                                                                       PART H


something more than a mere animal existence. The right under Article 21 includes the

enjoyment of those faculties which render the right meaningful. Hence, the first part

of the decision in Kharak Singh represents an amalgam of life, personal liberty and

privacy. It protects interests which are grounded in privacy under the rubric of liberty.

The difficulty in construing the decision arises because in the second part of its

decision, the majority upheld the rest of the regulation and observed (while doing so)

that there is an absence of a protected right to privacy under the Constitution. These

observations in the second part are at variance with those dealing with the first. The

view about the absence of a right to privacy is an isolated observation which cannot

coexist with the essential determination rendered on the first aspect of the regulation.

Subsequent Benches of this Court in the last five decades and more, have attempted

to make coherent doctrine out of the uneasy coexistence between the first and the

second parts of the decision in Kharak Singh. Several of them rely on the protection

of interests grounded in privacy in the first part, under the conceptual foundation of

ordered liberty.",

delivered by JAGANNADHADAS J.
1079
   JAGANNADHADAS   J.-These two applications are for  relief
under article 32 of the Constitution arising out of  similar
and  connected	set of facts and are  dealt  with  together.
They'arise under the following circumstances.  The Registrar
of   the   Joint  Stock	 Companies,  Delhi   State,   lodged
information with the Inspector General, Delhi Special Police
Establishment,	to  the following effect.   Messrs.   Dalmia
Jain  Airways Ltd. was registered in his office on  the	 9th
July, 1946, with an authorised capital of Rs. 10 crores	 and
went   into  liquidation  on  the  13th	 June,	 1952.	  An
investigation  into the affairs of the company was  ordered,
by the Government and the report of the inspector  appointed
under section 138 of the Indian Companies Act indicated that
an  organised  attempt was made from the  inception  of	 the
company	 to  misappropriate and embezzle the  funds  of	 the
company-and  declare  it  to be	 substantial  loss,  and  to
conceal	 from the shareholders the true state of affairs  by
submitting  false  accounts  and  balance-sheets.    Various
dishonest  and fraudulent transactions were  also  disclosed
which  show that false accounts with fictitious entries	 and
false  records	were  being maintained	and  that  dishonest
transfers  of  moneys  had been made.	It  was	 accordingly
alleged	 that  offences under sections 406,  408,  409,'418,
420, 465, 467, 468, 471 and 477(a) of the Indian Penal	Code
had  been  committed.  It was also stated that	Seth  R.  K.
Dalmia	who  was the Director and Chairman  of	Dalmia	Jain
Airways	 Ltd. has been controlling certain  other  concerns,
viz.,  (1)  Dalmia Cement & Paper Marketing Co.,  Ltd.,	 (2)
Dalmia Jain Aviation Ltd. now known as Asia Udyog Ltd.,	 and
(3) Allen Berry & Co., Ltd., through his nominees- and	that
all  these  concerns were utilised in order  to	 commit	 the
frauds.	  It was further stated therein by the Registrar  of
Joint  Stock Companies that to determine the extent  of	 the
fraud,	it  was necessary to get hold of books not  only  of
Dalmia	Jain  Airways Ltd. but also of the  allied  concerns
controlled  by the Dalmia group, some of which	are  outside
the  Delhi State.  Lists of the offices and places in  which
and  of	 the  persons in whose custody the  records  may  be
available were furnished.  Speedy


investigation was asked for.  This information was  recorded
by  the	 Special Police on the 19th November, 1953,  as	 the
First	Information  Report.   On  the	basis	thereof	  an
application  was  made to the  District	 Magistrate,  Delhi,
under  section	96 of the Criminal Procedure Code,  for	 the
issue  of  warrants for the search of documents and  in	 the
places,	  as   per  schedules  furnished.    Permission	  to
investigate  in	 respect  of  some  of	the   non-cognisable
offences mentioned in the First Information Report was	also
asked for.  On the same day, the District Magistrate ordered
investigation  of  the	offences  and  issued  warrants	 for
simultaneous searches at as many as 34 places.	The searches
were  made on the 25th November, 1953, and  subsequent	days
and  a	voluminous mass of records was seized  from  various
places.	  The petitioners pray that the search warrants	 may
be  quashed as being absolutely illegal, and ask for  return
of the documents seized.  In Petition No. 372 of 1953  there
are  four petitioners of whom the second is the Delhi  Glass
Works  Ltd.,  and  the	first  the  Deputy-General   Manager
thereof,   the	third  its  Secretary  and  the	  fourth   a
shareholder  therein. In Petition No. 375 of 1953 there	 are
five petitioners of whom the first is Messrs.  Allen Berry &
Co.,  Ltd.,  second Asia Udyog Ltd., the third	Shri  R.  K.
Dalmia, the fourth the Secretary and General Attorney of the
third and the fifth a shareholder of petitioners Nos.  I and
2, and an officer of petitioner No. 2. It will be seen	that
the  petitioners  in both the petitions belong to  the	four
concerns,  namely, (1) Delhi Glass Works Ltd' , (2)  Messrs.
Allen Berry & Co., Ltd., (3) Asia Udyog Ltd., and (4) Dalmia
Jain  Airways Ltd.  The last three are stated- to be  Dalmia
concerns  but  it does not appear from	the  records  placed
before	us what exact connection Delhi Glass Works Ltd.	 has
with them.  However, it is admittedly one of the places	 for
which  a search warrant was asked for and against which	 the
First  Information Report appears to have been	lodged.	  In
the  petitions various questions were raised.  But  such  of
them which raise only irregularities and illegalities of the
searches and do not involve any constitutional violation are
matters which may
be  more  appropriately canvassed before the High  Court  on
applications  under article 226 of the Constitution  and  we
have  declined	to  go into  them.   The  petitioners  have,
therefore,  confined themselves before us to two grounds  on
which  they  challenge the  constitutional  validity,of	 the
searches.   The contentions raised are that the	 fundamental
rights	of the petitioners under article 20(3)	and  article
19(1)(f) have been violated by the searches in question.
   So  far  as the contention based on article	19(1)(f)  is
concerned we are unable to see that the petitioners have any
arguable  case.	 Article 19(1)(f) declares the right of	 all
citizens to acquire, hold and dispose of property subject to
the operation of any existing or future law in so far as  it
imposes	 reasonable restrictions, on the exercise of any  of
the  rights conferred thereby, in the interests	 of  general
public.	  It  is  urged that the searches  and	seizures  as
effected  in  this case were unreasonable and  constitute  a
serious restriction on the right of the various petitioners,
inasmuch  as their buildings were invaded,  their  documents
taken  away  and their business and reputation	affected  by
these largescale and allegedly arbitrary searches and that a
law (section 96(1), Cr.P.C.) which authorises such  searches
violates the constitutional guarantee and is invalid.	But,
a search by itself is not a restriction on the right to hold
and enjoy property.  No doubt a seizure and carrying away is
a  restriction	of  the	 possession  and  enjoyment  of	 the
property  seized.  This, however, is only temporary and	 for
the limited purpose of investigation.  A search and  seizure
is, therefore, only a temporary interference with the  right
to  hold  the  premises searched and  the  articles  seized.
Statutory  regulation  in  this	 behalf	 is  necessary	 and
reasonable  restriction	 cannot per se be considered  to  be
unconstitutional.   The	 damage,  if  any  caused  by	such
temporary  interference	 if found to be in excess  of  legal
authority is a matter for redress in other proceedings.	  We
are unable to see how any question of violation. of  article
19(1)  (f)  is	involved  in this case	in  respect  of	 the
warrants in question which purport to be , under the first

alternative of section 96(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
   The	only substantial question, therefore, that has	been
raised	is the one relating to article 20(3) which  runs  as
follows:



   ""No	person accused of any offence shall be compelled  to
be a witness against himself.""
    The argument urged before us is that a search to  obtain
documents, for investigation into an offence is a compulsory
procuring of incriminatory evidence from the accused himself
and is, therefore, hit by article 20(3) as  unconstitutional
and  illegal.	It is not disputed that,  prima	 facIe,	 the
article	 in  question  has  nothing  to	 indicate  that	  it
comprehends  within its scope, the prohibition	of  searches
and  seizures of documents from the custody of	an  accused.
But it is urged that this is necessarily implied therein  by
certain canons of liberal construction which are  applicable
to  the	 interpretation of  constitutional  guarantees.	  In
support	 of  this line of argument great reliance  has	been
placed	upon American decisions in which  similar  questions
were  canvassed.  The argument on behalf of the	 petitioners
is   presented	in  the	 following  way.   The	 fundamental
guarantee in article 20(3) comprehends within its scope	 not
merely oral testimony given by an accused in a criminal case
pending against him, but also evidence of whatever character
compelled  out	of a person who is or is  likely  to  become
incriminated thereby as an accused.  It, therefore,  extends
not only to compelled production of documents by an  accused
from  his possession, but also to such compelled  production
of  oral or documentary evidence from any- other person	 who
may  become  incriminated thereby as an	 accused  in  future
proceedings.   If this view of the content of article 20(3)
is accepted, the next step in the argument presented is that
a forcible search and seizure of documents is, for  purposes
of constitutional protection of this guarantee, on the	same
footing	 as a compelled production of the said documents  by
the  person  from  whom	 they are  seized.   This  chain  of
reasoning,  if	accepted  in  its  entirety,  would   render
searches and seizures of documents and any

statutory  provisions  in that behalf illegal and  void,  as
being  in violation of the fundamental right  under  ArtiCle
20(3).	  The  question	 thus  raised  is   of	 farreaching
importance and requires careful consideration.
   Article 20(3)  embodies  the  principle  of	  protection
against compulsion of self-incrimination which is one of the
fundamental  canons  of	 the  British  system  of   criminal
jurisprudence  and  which has been adopted by  the  American
system	and incorporated as an article of its  Constitution.
It has also, to a substantial extent, been recognized in the
Anglo  Indian  administration of criminal  justice  in	this
country by incorporation into various statutory	 provisions.
In order, therefore, to arrive at a correct appraisal of the
scope  and  content  of the doctrine and to  judge  to	what
extent	 that	was  intended  to  be  recognised   by	 our
Constitution-makers  in	 article 20(3), it is  necessary  to
have a cursory view of the origin and scope of this doctrine
and  the implications thereof as understood in	English	 law
and in American law and as recognized in the Indian law.
   In  English	law, this principle  of	 protection  against
self-incrimination  had	 a historical origin.	It  resulted
from  a	 feeling  of  revulsion	 against  the  inquisitorial
methods adoPted and the barbarous sentences imposed, by	 the
Court  of  Star	 Chamber, in the exercise  of  its  criminal
jurisdiction.	This  came  to a head in the  case  of	John
Lilburn(1)  which  brought about the abolition of  the	Star
Chamber	 and the firm recognition of the principle that	 the
accused	 should	 not  be put on oath and  that	no  evidence
should	be  taken from him.  This principle,  in  course  of
time,  developed  into	its logical extensions,	 by  way  of
privilege  of  witnesses  against  self-incrimination,	when
called	for  giving  oral testimony  or	 for  production  of
documents.  A change was introduced by the Criminal Evidence
Act of 1898  By making an accused a competent witNess on his
own  behalf, if he applied for it.  But so far as  the	oral
testimony -of witnesses and the production of documents	 are
concerned, the protection against
(1)  3 State Trials 1315,
self-incrimination  continued  as before.  (See	 Phipson  on
Evidence, 9th Edition, pages 215 and 474).



within	the  meaning  of article 20(3)	and  also  that	 the
documents  for whose search the warrants were issued,  being
required  for investigation into the alleged offences,	such
searches were for incriminating material.  It may be noticed
that some of the accused enumerated in the First Information
Report are incorporated companies.  But no question has been
raised	before	us  that the protection does  not  apply  to
corporations or to documents belonging to them '-a  question
about  which  there  has been  considerable  debate  in	 the
American Courts.  On the above footing, therefore, the	only
substantial argument before us on this part of the case	 was
that  compelled production of incriminating  documents	from
the possession of an accused is compelling an accused to  be
a witness against himself.  This argument accordingly raises
mainly	the issue relating to the scope and  connotation  of
the second of the three components above stated
  Broadly  stated the guarantee in article 20(3) is  against
""testimonial  compulsion  "". It is suggested  that  this  is
confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial
for an offence when called to the witness-stand.  We can see
no  reason  to	confine the content  of	 the  constitutional
guarantee  to  this barely literal import.  So to  limit  it
would be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and
to  miss  the substance for the sound as stated	 in  certain
American  decisions.  The phrase used in article 20(3) is  ""



to  be a witness."" A person can "" be a witness "" not  merely
by giving oral evidence but also. by producing documents  or
making	intelligible  gestures	as in the  case	 of  a	dumb
witness	 (see section 119 of the Evidence Act) or the  like.
""  To  be  a witness "" is nothing more	than  ""	 to  furnish
evidence  "", and such evidence can be furnished through	 the
lips  or  by production of a thing or of a  document  or  in
other modes.  So far as


production  of documents is concerned, no doubt section	 139
of the Evidence Act says that a person producing a  document
on  summons is not a witness.  But that section is meant  to
regulate the right of cross-examination.  It is not a  guide
to  the connotation of the word "" witness"", which  must	 'be
understood  in	its natural sense, i.e., as referring  to  a
person	who  furnishes	evidence.   Indeed,  every  positive
volitional  act which furnishes evidence is  testimony,	 and
testimonial compulsion connotes coercion which procures	 the
positive  volitional  evidentiary  acts of  the	 person,  as
opposed	 to the, negative attitude of silence or  submission
on  his	 part.	Nor is there any reason to  think  that	 the
protection  in	respect	 of  the  evidence  so	procured  is
confined to what transpires at the trial in the court  room.
The  phrase used in article 20(3) is ""to be a  witness""	 and
not to ""appear as a witness"": It follows that the protection
afforded  to  an accused in so far as it is related  to	 the
phrase	""to  be	 a  witness' is not  merely  in	 respect  of
testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well extend
to compelled testimony previously obtained from him.  It  is
available  therefore  to  a person  against  whom  a  formal
accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been
levelled   which  in  the  normal'  course  may	 result	  in
prosecution.   Whether it is available to other	 persons  in
other situations does not call for decision in this case.
   Considered  in  this light the  guarantee  under  article
20(3)  would  be  available in the present  cases  to  these
petitioners against whom a First Information Report has been
recorded  as  accused  therein.	  It  would  extend  to	 any
compulsory  process for production of evidentiary  documents
which are reasonably likely to support a prosecution against
them.  The question then that arises next is whether  search
warrants for the seizure of such documents from the  custody
of  these persons are unconstitutional and hence illegal  on
the  ground that in effect they are tantamount to  compelled
production  of evidence.  It is urged that both	 search	 and
seizure of a document and a compelled production thereof  on
notice or summons serve the same purpose of being

available  as evidence in a prosecution	 against the  person
Concerned,  and that any other view would defeat  or  weaken
the Protection afforded by the guarantee of the	 fundamental
right.	 This  line, of argument is not	 altogether  without
force  and has the apparent support of the Supreme Court  of
the United States of America in Boyd V. United States(1).
    The	 question there which came up for consideration	 was
in   fact  the	converse,  namely,  whether   a	  compulsory
production  of documents on the facts of that case  amounted
to search and seizure.	There are dicta in that decision  to
the  effect that a compulsory production of a man's  private
papers	is  a search and seizure since it affects  the	sole
object	thereof and that by this process the  court  extorts
from  the  party his private books and papers  to  make	 him
liable for penalty.  It is necessary, therefore, to  examine
this  decision rather closely in order to determine how	 far
it  can	 be  a safe guide for  our  purpose.   The  question
therein	 arose under the following circumstances. In an	 Act
to  amend the, Customs Revenue Laws, there was	a  provision
which  enabled	the Government Attorney to  make  a  written
motion	to  the	 court	for the issue of  a  notice  to	 the
opposite-party	for production of papers in his	 possession.
The motion could be made if in the Attorney's opinion  those
books contain materials which will prove an alleged fact  in
support	 of a charge of defrauding the	revenues,  involving
penalty	 and  forfeiture of merchandise to which  the  fraud
relates.   It is also provided by the said section  that  if
the  court in its discretion allows the motion in  which  is
set  out  the fact sought to be proved and  calls  upon	 the
defendant to produce the documents, and the defendant  fails
or   refuses  to  produce  them	 without  any	proper	 and
satisfactory  explanation, the allegation of fact sought  to
be  proved  by such production may be deemed  to  have	been
confessed.  The question that thereupon arose was whether an
order  for production made by the court under  that  section
did  not violate the constitutional rights declared  by	 the
Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the
(1)  116 U.S. 616.",
Article 20,"Directorate Of Enforcement vs Deepak Mahajan on 31 January, 1994",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1013766/?formInput=Article%2020,,"75. The prohibitive sweep of Article 20(3) which imposes the
ban  on	 self-accusation reads, ""No person  accused  of	 any
offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.""
76. In explaining the intendment of Article 20(3),  relating
to search and seizure of documents under Sections 94 and  96
of the old Code, an eight Judge Bench of this Court in	M.P.
Sharma v. Satish Chandra, District Magistrate, Delhi21	held
that one of the components for invoking sub-clause
20 (1910) It Cri LJ 251: 7 MLJ 104: 5 IC 809 (Mad)
21 1954 SCR 1077: AIR 1954 SC 300: 1954 Cri LJ 865

(3) of Article 20 should be that it is a right pertaining to
a person 'accused of an	 offence.'



78.Thereafter,	a Constitution Bench of this Court  in	Raja
Narayanlal Bansilal v. Maneck Phiroz Mistry22 while  dealing
with  the import of Article 20(3) with reference to  certain
provisions  of the Indian Companies Act made  the  following
observation, relying on the decision in M.P. Sharma21:	(SCR
p. 438)
	      ""Similarly,  for invoking	 the  constitutional
	      right    against	  testimonial	  compulsion
	      guaranteed under Article 20(3) it must  appear
	      that a formal accusation has been made against
	      the  party pleading the guarantee and that  it
	      relates to the commission of an offence  which
	      in   the	 normal	  course   may	 result	  in
	      prosecution.   Here  again the nature  of	 the
	      accusation   and	 its  probable	 sequel	  or
	      consequence are regarded as important.""
In  the	 above	two judgments, both  the  Benches  have	 not
discussed  the distinction between the	expression  'accused
person' and 'person accused of any offence'.



81.  The essence of the above decisions is that to  bring  a
person within the meaning of 'accused of any offence',	that
person must assimilate the character of an 'accused  person'
in the sense that he must be accused of any offence.
82.We think it is not necessary to interpret the expression,
""person	 accused  of any offence"" as  appearing	 in  Article
20(3) any more but suffice to note that the same  expression
is found in Sections 25 and 27 of the Evidence Act.
83.  It	 is  apposite to note that clauses  (1)	 to  (3)  of
Article	 22 which speak of a 'person arrested' use only	 the
word 'person'.	Article 22(2) states that ""every person	 who
is   arrested  and  detained  in  custody......	 A   similar
expression  is used in Section 167(1) of the  code  reading,
""Whenever   any	  person  is  arrested	 and   detained	  in
custody....... Thus while referring to a person arrested and
detained  neither  Article 22 nor Section  167	employs	 the
expression ""accused of any offence"".



89.  In	 a  recent  decision, this  Court  in  Poolpandi  v.
Superintendent,	 Central  Excise28 has reiterated  the	same
view  and  held	 that a	 person	 being	interrogated  during
investigation  under  Customs Act or FERA is  not  a  person
accused	 of any offence within the meaning of Article 20(3)
of the Constitution. See also Percy Rustomji Basta v. State
of Maharashtra29.
90.In  this connection, reference may be made to a  decision
in   Ramanlal  Bhogilal	 Shah  v.  D.K.	 Guha30	 which	 has
distinguished  Ramesh Chandra Mehta26 and held on the  facts
of  that case that the person served with summons under	 the
FERA, was an accused within the meaning of Article 20(3)  of
the  Constitution  of  India.	The  decision  in   Ramanlal
Bhogilal30  has	 taken a different view to  that  of  Ramesh
Chandra	 Mehta26 which view was examined in Poolpandi28	 and
was  distinguished  on the ground that a  first	 information
report	in Ramanlal Bhogilal Shah30 has been lodged  earlier
and consequently it was settled that the person was  accused
of an offence within the meaning of Article 20(3).",

BHAGWATI J.-- This appeal by special leave from a   judgment
and  order of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay  raises
an  important  question as to the  construction	 of  article
20(2) of the Constitution.
The  appellant,	 a citizen of Bharat, arrived at  the  Santa
Cruz  airport  from Jeddah on the 6th  November,  1949.	  On
landing he did not declare that he had brought in gold	with
him  but  on search it was found that he had  brought  107.2
tolas  of gold in contravention of the notification  of	 the
Government of India dated the 25th August,1948.	 The Customs
Authorities thereupon took action under section 167,  clause
(8),  of the Sea Customs Act VIII of 1878,  and	 confiscated
the  gold  by an order dated the 19th December,	 1949.	 The
owner  of  the gold was however given the option to  pay  in
lieu of such confiscation a fine of Rs. 12,000, which option
was  to be exercised within four months of the date  of	 the
order.	 A copy of the order was sent on the  30th  January,
1950,  to the appellant.  Nobody came forward to redeem	 the
gold.  On the 22nd March, 1950, a complaint was filed in the
Court  of the Chief Presidency Magistrate,  Bombay,  against
the appellant charging him with having committed an  offence
under  section 8 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act	 VII
of  1947, read with the notification dated the 25th  August,
1948.  The appellant thereupon on the 12th June, 1950, filed
a petition in the High Court of Bombay under article 228  of
the  Constitution  contending that his	prosecution  in	 the
Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate was in violation of
the fundamental right guaranteed to him under article 20(2)
of the Constitution and praying that as the case involved  a
substantial question of law as to the interpretation of	 the
Constitution,  the determination of which was necessary	 for
the disposal of the case, the case may be withdrawn from the
file  of the Chief Presidency Magistrate to the	 High  Court
and the High Court may either dispose of the case themselves
or determine the question of law and return it to the  Chief
Presidency  Magistrate's  Court for disposal.	A  rule	 was
issued by the High Court on

the  26th June, 1950, which came on for hearing on  the	 9th
August,	 1950,	before Bavdekar and Vyas JJ.  The  rule	 was
made   absolute	 and  the  High	 Court	directed  that	 the
proceedings  pending against the appellant in the  Court  of
the  Chief  Presidency Magistrate be withdrawn	and  brought
before the High Court under article 228 of the Constitution.
The case was thereupon withdrawn and brought before the High
Court  and was heard by the High Court on the 17th  October,
1950.  The learned Judges of the High Court, Chagla C.J. and
Gajendragadkar	J.  were of the opinion that  the  appellant
could claim the benefit of article 20(2) only if he was	 the
owner of the gold which was confiscated and that before they
decided	 as  to whether there had been a prosecution  and  a
punishment  within  the	 meaning of  article 20(2)  it	 was
necessary  that	 the  Chief  Presidency	 Magistrate   should
determine  the question of fact as to whether the  appellant
was the owner of the gold which had been confiscated and  in
respect of which an option was given to him as stated above.
They therefore sent the matter back to the Chief  Presidency
Magistrate directing him to find a; to whether the appellant
was or was not the owner of the gold stating that they would
deal  with the application after the finding  was  returned.
The Chief Presidency Magistrate recorded evidence and on the
20th January, 1950, recorded the finding that the  appellant
was  the  owner	 of the gold in question  and  returned	 the
finding to the High Court.  Chagla C.J. and Gajendra  gadkar
J.  heard the petition further on the 12th  February,  1951.
They   reversed	  the  finding	of  the	  Chief	  Presidency
Magistrate,  dismissed the application of the appellant	 and
directed  that	the  case  should  go  back  to	 the   Chief
Presidency  Magistrate for disposal according to  law.	 The
appellant obtained on the 1st November, 1951, special  leave
to appeal against the judgment and order passed by the	High
Court.



   The	 word	offence	 has  not  been	 defined   in	the
Constitution.	But  article 367 provides that	the  General
Clauses	 Act,  1897 (Act X of 1897), shall  apply  for,	 the
interpretation	of the Constitution.  Section 3(37)  of	 the
General	 Clauses Act defines an offence to mean any  act  or
omission  made punishable by any law for the time  being  in
force  and there is no doubt that both under the  provisions
of section 167 (8) of the Sea Customs Act and section 23  of
the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act the act of the appellant
was made punishable and constituted an offence.
  In  order  however to attract the  operation	of  article
20(2)  the appellant must have been prosecuted and  punished
for the same offence when proceedings were taken by the	 Sea
Customs Authorities.  The

High  Court did not go into the question as to	whether	 the
appellant was prosecuted when proceedings were taken  before
the Sea Customs Authorities.  It considered the question  of
punishment in the first instance and thought it necessary to
arrive at a' finding as to the ownership of the	 confiscated
gold  before  it  could	 consider  the	application  of	 the
appellant.   In the opinion of the High Court the  appellant
could  be  said	 to  have been	punished  only	if  it	were
established  that he was the owner of the confiscated  gold.
If  he	was the owner, the confiscation	 was  a	 punishment,
which would not be so if he was not the owner of the gold.
  This question of the ownership of the gold was not in our
opinion	 material.  The gold was found in the possession  of
the appellant when he landed at the Santa Cruz airport.	 The
appellant   was	 detained  and	searched  by   the   Customs
Authorities  and  the  gold  was  seized  from	his  person.
Proceedings  under section 167(8) were taken by the  Customs
Authorities  and  after	 examining witnesses  an  order	 was
passed on the 19th December, 1949, confiscating the gold and
giving an option to the owner to pay a fine of Rs. 12,000 in
lieu  of  such	confiscation under section 183	of  the	 Sea
Customs	 Act.	Copy  of this order  was  forwarded  to	 the
appellant  and for all practical purposes the appellant	 was
treated	 as the owner of the confiscated gold.	As a  matter
of  fact  when	evidence  was  recorded	 before	 the   Chief
Presidency  Magistrate on remand the Assistant Collector  of
Customs gave evidence that no one else had claimed the	gold
and  had  the appellant paid the penalty  and  obtained	 the
Reserve Bank permit and produced the detention slip he would
have  been given the gold.  Once the appellant was found  in
possession  of	the confiscated gold the burden	 of  proving
that be was not the owner would fall upon whosoever affirmed
that he was not the owner.  The complaint which was filed in
the  Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay,	also
proceeded  on  the footing that the appellant  committed  an
offence in so far as he brought the gold without the  permit
from

the Reserve Bank of India, that no permit was ever   applied
for or granted to the appellant and that the  appellant	 had
been given an opportunity of showing whether he had obtained
such  permit  but that he failed to produce  the  same.	  It
appears	 therefore that the question of the ownership  could
not assume as much importance is the High Court attached  to
it.  If the Court came to the conclusion that the  appellant
was  prosecuted	 when  proceedings were	 taken	by  the	 Sea
Customs	 Authorities there was not much scope left  for	 the
argument that he was not punished by the confiscation of the
gold and the option given to him to pay a fine of Rs. 12,000
in  lieu of such confiscation.	To be deprived of the  right
of  possession	of valuable goods may well  be	regarded  in
certain	 circumstances as by itself a punishment.   We	have
therefore  got to determine whether under the  circumstances
the  appellant	can  be said to have  been  prosecuted	when
proceedings were taken by the Sea Customs Authorities.
 The fundamental right which is guaranteed in article 20(2)
enunciates  the principle of ""autrefois convict"" or  ""double
jeopardy"".   The roots of that principle are to be found  in
the well established rule of the common law of England ""that
where  a person has been convicted of an offence by a  court
of  competent  jurisdiction the conviction is a bar  to	 all
further	 criminal  proceedings for the same  offence.""	(Per
Charles J. in Beg. v. Miles (1).  To the same effect is	 the
ancient maxim ""Nemo bis debet punire pro uno delicto"",	that
is  to	say that no one ought to be twice punished  for	 one
offence	 or  as it is sometimes written ""pro  eadem  causa"",
that is, for the same cause.



 The  'words ""before a court of law or	judicial  tribunal""
are not to be found in article 90(2).  But if regard be	 had
to the whole background indicated above it is clear that  in
order  that the protection of article 20(2) be invoked by  a
citizen there must have been a prosecution and punishment in
respect	 of  the  same offence before a court of  law  or  a
tribunal,required  by  law  to decide the  matters  in	con-
troversy  judicially  on evidence on oath which it  must  be
authorised  by law to administer and not before	 a  tribunal
which  entertains  a  departmental  or	ail   administrative
enquiry even though set up by a statute but not required  to
proceed	 on legal evidence given on oath.  The very  wording
of  article 20	 and  the  words  used	therein:""  convicted
commission of

the  act charged as an offence"", ""be subjected to a  penalty
"", "" commission of the offence "", "" prosecuted and  punished
"",  ""  accused of any offence "", would	indicate,  that	 the
proceedings  therein  contemplated  are	 of  the  nature  of
criminal  proceedings  before a court of law or	 a  judicial
tribunal  and the prosecution in this context would mean  an
initiation  or starting of proceedings of a criminal  nature
before	a court of law or a judicial tribunal in  accordance
with  the procedure prescribed in the statute which  creates
the offence and regulates the procedure.



 It  was urged by Jagjit Singh that the	 proceedings  which
were   adopted	by  the	 Jail  Superintendent  against	 the
petitioners amounted to their prosecution and punishment for
the  same offence and that therefore the  prosecution  which
was  now  launched  against them was  not  competent  as  it
exposed them to double jeopardy and violated the fundamental
right guaranteed to them under article 20(2).  It was on the
other hand urged by the Advocate-General of Punjab that	 the
Jail Superintendent merely took disciplinary action  against
the  petitioners and the punishment if any which  was  meted
out  to	 them  was for breaches	 of  discipline	 within	 the
meaning of section 4(a) of the Act and the Punjab  Communist
Detenus	 Rules, 1950, framed thereunder, that there  was  no
prosecution  and  punishment of the petitioners	 within	 the
meaning	 of article 20(2) and that therefore  the  petitions
were liable to be dismissed.",

SC 1295, Subba Rao, J. defined `personal liberty, as a right of an

individual to be free from restrictions or encroachment on his

person whether these are directly imposed or indirectly brought

about by calculated measure.      The court held that `personal

liberty' in Article 21 includes all varieties of freedoms except

those included in Article 19.


65.   In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Another (1978)

1 SCC 248, this court expanded the scope of the expression

`personal liberty' as used in Article 21 of the Constitution of

India.     The court rejected the argument that the expression

`personal liberty' must be so interpreted as to avoid overlapping

between Article 21 and Article 19(1).    It was observed:    ""The

expression `personal liberty' in Article 21 is of the widest

amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute

the personal liberty of a man and some of them have been raised

to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional

protection under Article 19."" So, the phrase `personal liberty' is


very wide and includes all possible rights which go to constitute

personal liberty, including those which are mentioned in Article



71.   The object of Article 21 is to prevent encroachment upon

personal liberty in any manner.       Article 21 is repository of all

human rights essentially for a person or a citizen. A fruitful and

meaningful life presupposes full of dignity, honour, health and

welfare. In the modern ""Welfare Philosophy"", it is for the State to

ensure these essentials of life to all its citizens, and if possible to

non-citizens. While invoking the provisions of Article 21, and by

referring to the oft-quoted statement of Joseph Addision, ""Better

to die ten thousand deaths than wound my honour"", the Apex

court in Khedat Mazdoor Chetana Sangath v. State of M.P.

and Others (1994) 6 SCC 260 posed to itself a question ""If

dignity or honour vanishes what remains of life""?         This is the

significance of the Right to Life and Personal Liberty guaranteed

under the Constitution of India in its third part.




107. The restriction on the provision of anticipatory bail under

section 438 Cr.P.C. limits the personal liberty of the accused

granted under Article 21 of the constitution.         The added

observation is nowhere found in the enactment and bringing in

restrictions which are not found in the enactment is again an

unreasonable restriction. It would not stand the test of fairness

and reasonableness which is implicit in Article 21 of the

Constitution after the decision in Maneka Gandhi's case (supra)

in which the court observed that in order to meet the challenge

of Article 21 of the Constitution the procedure established by law

for depriving a person of his liberty must be fair, just and

reasonable.



      ""The validity of that section must accordingly be
     examined by the test of fairness and reasonableness
     which is implicit in Article 21. If the legislature itself
     were to impose an unreasonable restriction on the
     grant of anticipatory bail, such a restriction could
     have been struck down as being violative of Article 21.
     Therefore, while determining the scope of Section 438,
     the court should not impose any unfair or


unreasonable limitation on the individual's right to
obtain an order of anticipatory bail. Imposition of an
unfair or unreasonable limitation, according to the
learned Counsel, would be violative of Article 21,
irrespective of whether it is imposed by legislation or
by judicial decision.",

         Liberty


 17. Before we proceed to expand upon the parameters of the right to default
bail under Section 167(2) as interpreted by various decisions of this Court,
we find it pertinent to note the observations made by this Court in Uday
Mohanlal Acharya [Uday Mohanlal Acharya v. State of Maharashtra,
(2001) 5 SCC 453 : 2001 SCC (Cri) 760] on the fundamental right to
personal liberty of the person and the effect of deprivation of the same as
follows: (SCC p. 472, para 13)

     “13. … Personal liberty is one of the cherished objects of the Indian
     Constitution and deprivation of the same can only be in accordance
     with law and in conformity with the provisions thereof, as stipulated
     under Article 21 of the Constitution. When the law provides that the
     Magistrate could authorise the detention of the accused in custody up
     to a maximum period as indicated in the proviso to sub-section (2) of
     Section 167, any further detention beyond the period without filing of
     a challan by the investigating agency would be a subterfuge and
     would not be in accordance with law and in conformity with the
     provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, and as such, could be
     violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.”

17.1. Article 21 of the Constitution of India provides that “no person shall
be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure
established by law”. It has been settled by a Constitution Bench of this
Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India [Maneka Gandhi v. Union of
India, (1978) 1 SCC 248], that such a procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair
or unreasonable. The history of the enactment of Section 167(2) CrPC and
the safeguard of “default bail” contained in the proviso thereto is
intrinsically linked to Article 21 and is nothing but a legislative exposition
of the constitutional safeguard that no person shall be detained except in
accordance with rule of law.



      In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a
      speedy and public trial.
So also Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides
that:

                                   46
           Every one arrested or detained . . . shall be entitled to trial within a
           reasonable time or to release pending trial.
 We think that even under our Constitution, though speedy trial is not
     specifically enumerated as a fundamental right, it is implicit in the broad
     sweep and content of Article 21 as interpreted by this Court in Maneka
     Gandhi v. Union of India [(1978) 2 SCR 621 : (1978) 1 SCC 248]. We have
     held in that case that Article 21 confers a fundamental right on every person
     not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the
     procedure prescribed by law and it is not enough to constitute compliance
     with the requirement of that article that some semblance of a procedure
     should be prescribed by law, but that the procedure should be “reasonable,
     fair and just”. If a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which
     is not “reasonable, fair or just”, such deprivation would be violative of his
     fundamental right under Article 21, and he would be entitled to enforce
     such fundamental right and secure his release. Now obviously procedure
     prescribed by law for depriving a person of liberty cannot be ‘reasonable,
     fair or just’ unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of
     the guilt of such person. No procedure which does not ensure a reasonably
     quick trial can be regarded as ‘reasonable, fair or just’ and it would fall foul
     of Article 21. There can, therefore, be no doubt that speedy trial, and by
     speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial, is an integral and
     essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in
     Article 21. The question which would, however, arise is as to what would
     be the consequence if a person accused of an offence is denied speedy trial
     and is sought to be deprived of his liberty by imprisonment as a result of a
     long-delayed trial in violation of his fundamental right under Article 21.
     Would he be entitled to be released unconditionally freed from the charge
     levelled against him on the ground that trying him after an unduly long
     period of time and convicting him after such trial would constitute violation
     of his fundamental right under Article 21. That is a question we shall have
     to consider when we hear the writ petition on merits on the adjourned date.
     But one thing is certain, and we cannot impress it too strongly on the State
     Government that it is high time that the State Government realized its
     responsibility to the people in the matter of administration of justice and set
     up more courts for the trial of cases. We may point out that it would not be
     enough merely to establish more courts but the State Government would
     also have to man them by competent Judges and whatever is necessary for
     the purpose of recruiting competent Judges, such as improving their
     conditions of service, would have to be done by the State Government, if
     they want to improve the system of administration of justice and make it an
     effective instrument for reaching justice to the large masses of people for
     whom justice is today a meaningless and empty word.”

 Surinder Singh @ Shingara Singh vs State Of Punjab, 2005 (7) SCC

  387:

     “8. It is no doubt true that this Court has repeatedly emphasised the fact that
     speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in the broad sweep and content
     of Article 21 of the Constitution. The aforesaid article confers a
     fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty
     except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. If a person is
     deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not reasonable, fair, or
     just, such deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right under
     Article 21 of the Constitution. It has also been emphasised by this Court
     that the procedure so prescribed must ensure a speedy trial for
     determination of the guilt of such person. It is conceded that some amount
     of deprivation of personal liberty cannot be avoided, but if the period of
     deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, the fairness assured by
     Article 21 would receive a jolt. These are observations made in several
     decisions of this Court dealing with the subject of speedy trial. In this case,
     we are concerned with the case where a person has been found guilty of an
     offence punishable under Section 302 IPC and who has been sentenced to
     imprisonment for life. The Code of Criminal Procedure affords a right of
     appeal to such a convict. The difficulty arises when the appeal preferred by
     such a convict cannot be disposed of within a reasonable time. In Kashmira
     Singh v. State of Punjab [(1977) 4 SCC 291 : 1977 SCC (Cri) 559] this
     Court dealt with such a case. It is observed: (SCC pp. 292-93, para 2)
           “The practice not to release on bail a person who has been sentenced
           to life imprisonment was evolved in the High Courts and in this Court


     on the basis that once a person has been found guilty and sentenced to
     life imprisonment, he should not be let loose, so long as his
     conviction and sentence are not set aside, but the underlying postulate
     of this practice was that the appeal of such person would be disposed
     of within a measurable distance of time, so that if he is ultimately
     found to be innocent, he would not have to remain in jail for an
     unduly long period. The rationale of this practice can have no
     application where the Court is not in a position to dispose of the
     appeal for five or six years. It would indeed be a travesty of justice to
     keep a person in jail for a period of five or six years for an offence
     which is ultimately found not to have been committed by him. Can
     the Court ever compensate him for his incarceration which is found to
     be unjustified? Would it be just at all for the Court to tell a person:
     ‘We have admitted your appeal because we think you have a prima
     facie case, but unfortunately we have no time to hear your appeal for
     quite a few years and, therefore, until we hear your appeal, you must
     remain in jail, even though you may be innocent?’ What confidence
     would such administration of justice inspire in the mind of the public?
     It may quite conceivably happen, and it has in fact happened in a few
     cases in this Court, that a person may serve out his full term of
     imprisonment before his appeal is taken up for hearing. Would a
     judge not be overwhelmed with a feeling of contrition while
     acquitting such a person after hearing the appeal? Would it not be an
     affront to his sense of justice? Of what avail would the acquittal be to
     such a person who has already served out his term of imprisonment or
     at any rate a major part of it? It is, therefore, absolutely essential that
     the practice which this Court has been following in the past must be
     reconsidered and so long as this Court is not in a position to hear the
     appeal of an accused within a reasonable period of time, the Court
     should ordinarily, unless there are cogent grounds for acting
     otherwise, release the accused on bail in cases where special leave has
     been granted to the accused to appeal against his conviction and
     sentence.”



 Since the number of courts constituted to try offences under the Act were
    not sufficient and the appointments of Judges to man these courts were
    delayed, cases piled up and the provision in regard to enlargement on bail
    being strict the offenders have had to languish in jails for want of trials. As
    stated earlier Section 37 of the Act makes every offence punishable under
    the Act cognizable and non-bailable and provides that no person accused of
    an offence punishable for a term of five years or more shall be released on
    bail unless (i) the Public Prosecutor has had an opportunity to oppose bail
    and (ii) if opposed, the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds
    for believing that he is not guilty of the offence and is not likely to indulge
    in similar activity. On account of the strict language of the said provision
    very few persons accused of certain offences under the Act could secure
    bail. Now to refuse bail on the one hand and to delay trial of cases on the
    other is clearly unfair and unreasonable and contrary to the spirit of Section
    36(1) of the Act, Section 309 of the Code and Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the
    Constitution. We are conscious of the statutory provision finding place in
    Section 37 of the Act prescribing the conditions which have to be satisfied



before a person accused of an offence under the Act can be released. Indeed,
we have adverted to this section in the earlier part of the judgment. We have
also kept in mind the interpretation placed on a similar provision in Section
20 of the TADA Act by the Constitution Bench in Kartar Singh v. State of
Punjab [(1994) 3 SCC 569 : 1994 SCC (Cri) 899]. Despite this provision,
we have directed as above mainly at the call of Article 21 as the right to
speedy trial may even require in some cases quashing of a criminal
proceeding altogether, as held by a Constitution Bench of this Court in A.R.
Antulay v. R.S. Nayak [(1992) 1 SCC 225 : 1992 SCC (Cri) 93], release on
bail, which can be taken to be embedded in the right of speedy trial, may, in
some cases be the demand of Article 21. As we have not felt inclined to
accept the extreme submission of quashing the proceedings and setting free
the accused whose trials have been delayed beyond reasonable time for
reasons already alluded to, we have felt that deprivation of the personal
liberty without ensuring speedy trial would also not be in consonance with
the right guaranteed by Article 21. Of course, some amount of deprivation
of personal liberty cannot be avoided in such cases; but if the period of
deprivation pending trial becomes unduly long, the fairness assured by
Article 21 would receive a jolt. It is because of this that we have felt that
after the accused persons have suffered imprisonment which is half of the
maximum punishment provided for the offence, any further deprivation of
personal liberty would be violative of the fundamental right visualised by
Article 21, which has to be telescoped with the right guaranteed by Article
14 which also promises justness, fairness and reasonableness in procedural
matters. What then is the remedy? The offences under the Act are grave and,
therefore, we are not inclined to agree with the submission of the learned
counsel for the petitioner that we should quash the prosecutions and set free
the accused persons whose trials are delayed beyond reasonable time.
Alternatively, he contended that such accused persons whose trials have
been delayed beyond reasonable time and are likely to be further delayed
should be released on bail on such terms as this Court considers appropriate
to impose. This suggestion commends to us. We were told by the learned
counsel for the State of Maharashtra that additional Special Courts have
since been constituted but having regard to the large pendency of such cases
in the State we are afraid this is not likely to make a significant dent in the
huge pile of such cases. We, therefore, direct as under:",

inhibition of  Article 21  of the  Constitution, whether  it
occurs during  investigation, interrogation or otherwise. If
the functionaries  of the Government become law breakers, it
is bound  to breed  contempt for  law  and  would  encourage
lawlessness and	 every man would have the tendency to become
law  unto   himself  thereby   leading	to  anarchanism.  No
civilised nation  can permit  that tp happen. Does a citizen
shed off  his  fundamental  right  to  life,  the  moment  a
policeman arrests him? Can the right to life of a citizen be
put in	abeyance on  his arrest?  These questions  touch the
spinal court  of human	rights	jurisprudence.	The  answer,
indeed, has  to be  an emphatic	 'No'.	The  precious  right
guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution of India cannot
be denied  to  convicted  undertrials,	detenues  and  other
prisoners in  custody, except  according  to  the  procedure
established by	law by	placing such reasonable restrictions
as are permitted by law.



     In Neelabati  Bahera Vs. State of Orissa [1993 (2) SCC,
746], (to  which Anand,	 J. was	 a party) this Court pointed
out that  prisoners and	 detenues are  not denuded  of their
fundamental rights  under Article 21 and  it is  only	such
restrictions as	 are permitted	by law, which can be imposed
on the	enjoyment of the fundamental rights of the arrestees
and detenues. It was observed :
     ""It  is  axiomatic	 that  convicts,
     prisoners or  undertrials	are  not
     denuded of their fundamental rights
     under Article 21 and  its is  only
     such restrictions, as are permitted
     by law, which can be imposed on the
     enjoyment of  the fundamental right
     by	  such	 persons.   It	 is   an
     obligation of  the State  to ensure
     that there	 is no	infringement  of
     the  indefeasible	 rights	  of   a
     citizen   o    life,   except    in
     accordance	 with	law,  while  the
     citizen  is  in  its  custody.  The
     precious	right	 guaranteed   by
     Article 21	 of the	 constitution of
     India cannot be denied to convicts,
     undertrials or  other prisoners  in
     custody,	expect	  according   to
     procedure established by law. There
     is a  great   responsibility on the
     police  or	 prison	 authorities  to
     ensure  that  the	citizen	 in  its
     custody  is  not  deprived	 of  his
     right to  life. His  liberty is  in
     the   very	   nature   of	  things
     circumscribed by  the very	 fact of
     his confinement  and therefore  his
     interest  in  the	limited	 liberty
     left to him is rather precious. The
     duty of  care on  the part	 of  the
     State is  responsible if the person
     in	 custody   of  the   police   is
     deprived	of   his   life	  except
     according	  to	the    procedure
     established by law.



     The  claim	  in  public   law  for	  compensation	 for
unconstitutional deprivation  of fundamental  right to	life
and liberty, the protection of which is guaranteed under the
Constitution, is a claim based on strict liability and is in
addition to  the claim	available in private law for damages
of  tortious   acts  of	 the  public  servants.	 Public	 law
proceedings serve  a different	purpose than the private law
proceedings.   Award   of   compensation   for	 established
infringement of	 the indefeasible  rights  guaranteed  under
Article 21  of the  Constitutions  is  remedy  available  in
public law  since the  purpose of  public law is not only to
civilise public	 power but  also to assure the citizens that
they live  under a  legal system  wherein their	 rights	 and
interests  shall   be  protected  and  preserved.  Grant  of
compensation in	 proceedings under  Article 32 or 226 of the
Constitution of	 India for  the established violation or the
fundamental  rights  guaranteed	 under	Article 21,  is  an
exercise of the Courts under the public law jurisdiction for
penalising the	wrong door  and fixing the liability for the
public wrong  on the  State which failed in the discharge of
its public  duty to  protect the  fundamental rights  of the
citizen.



     In Nilabati Bahera's case (supra), it was held:
     ""Adverting to  the grant  of relief
     to	 the   heirs  of   a  victim  of
     custodial death  for the infraction
     or	  invasion    of   his	  rights
     guaranteed under  Article 21 of the
     Constitution of  India, it	 is  not
     always enough  to relegate	 him  to
     the ordinary remedy of a civil suit
     to claim  damages for  the tortious
     act of  the State as that remedy in
     private law  indeed is available to
     the aggrieved  party.  The	 citizen
     complaining of  the infringement of
     the   indefeasible	   right   under
     Article 21   of  the  constitution
     cannot  be	  told	that   for   the
     established   violation	of   the
     fundamental right to life he cannot
     get any relief under the public law
     by	 the   courts  exercising   Writ

     the public	 law  proceedings  stems
     from the  prerogative writs and the

for long time. Learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellant Mr. Kapil

Sibal and Mr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi made meticulous submissions on the

concept of life and liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India

to urge that the appellant is entitled to the privilege of anticipatory bail.

Arguments were also advanced on various aspects – whether the court can

look   into   the   materials   produced   by the    respondent-Enforcement

Directorate to seek custody of the appellant when the appellant was not

confronted with those documents on the three dates of interrogation of the

appellant     conducted   on    19.12.2018,   01.01.2019    and    21.01.2019.

Interlocutory application was filed by the appellant to produce the

transcripts of the questions put to the appellant and the answers given by

the appellant, recorded by Enforcement Directorate. Countering the above

submissions, Mr. Tushar Mehta, learned Solicitor General made the

submissions that grant of anticipatory bail is not part of Article 21 of the


Constitution of India. Mr. Tushar Mehta urged that having regard to the

materials collected by the respondent-Enforcement Directorate and the

specific inputs and in view of the provisions of the special enactment-

PMLA, custodial interrogation of the appellant is required and the appellant

is not entitled to the privilege of anticipatory bail.



68.   On behalf of the appellant, much arguments were advanced

contending that anticipatory bail is a facet of Article 21 of the Constitution of

India. It was contended that unless custodial interrogation is warranted, in

the facts and circumstances of the case, denial of anticipatory bail would

amount to denial of the right conferred upon the appellant under Article 21

of the Constitution of India.

69.   Article 21 of the Constitution of India states that no person shall be

deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure

prescribed by law.     However, the power conferred by Article 21 of the

Constitution of India is not unfettered and is qualified by the later part of the

Article i.e. “…except according to a procedure prescribed by law.” In State

of M.P. and another v. Ram Kishna Balothia and another (1995) 3 SCC 221,

the Supreme Court held that the right of anticipatory bail is not a part of

Article 21 of the Constitution of India and held as under:-



      “7. ……We find it difficult to accept the contention that Section 438 of the
      Code of Criminal Procedure is an integral part of Article 21. In the first place,
      there was no provision similar to Section 438 in the old Criminal Procedure
      Code. The Law Commission in its 41st Report recommended introduction of a
      provision for grant of anticipatory bail. It observed:
         “We agree that this would be a useful advantage. Though we must
         add that it is in very exceptional cases that such power should be
         exercised.”
      In the light of this recommendation, Section 438 was incorporated, for the first
      time, in the Criminal Procedure Code of 1973. Looking to the cautious
      recommendation of the Law Commission, the power to grant anticipatory bail
      is conferred only on a Court of Session or the High Court. Also, anticipatory
      bail cannot be granted as a matter of right. It is essentially a statutory right
      conferred long after the coming into force of the Constitution. It cannot be
      considered as an essential ingredient of Article 21 of the Constitution. And its
      non-application to a certain special category of offences cannot be considered
      as violative of Article 21.” [underlining added]






70.   We are conscious of the fact that the legislative intent behind the

introduction of Section 438 Cr.P.C. is to safeguard the individual’s personal

liberty and to protect him from the possibility of being humiliated and from

being subjected to unnecessary police custody. However, the court must

also keep in view that a criminal offence is not just an offence against an


individual, rather the larger societal interest is at stake.       Therefore, a

delicate balance is required to be established between the two rights -

safeguarding the personal liberty of an individual and the societal interest. It

cannot be said that refusal to grant anticipatory bail would amount to denial

of the rights conferred upon the appellant under Article 21 of the

Constitution of India.",
Article 21,"Maneka Gandhi vs Union Of India on 25 January, 1978",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1766147/?formInput=Article%2021,,"(h),  The order impounding the passport in the present	case
was  made by the Central Government under clause  (c)  which
reads as follows:--
	      ""(c)  if	the  passport  authority  deems	  it
	      necessary	 so  to do in the  interest  of	 the
	      Sovereignty   and	 Integrity  of	India,	 the
	      security of India, friendly relations of India
	      with any foreign country, or in the  interests
	      of the general public;""
The  particular ground relied upon for making the order	 was
that  set out in the last part of clause (c),  namely,	that
the  Central  Government deems it necessary to	impound	 the
passport  ""in  the interests of the  general  public.""	Then
follows sub-section (5) which requires the

passport  authority  impounding or revoking  a	passport  or
travel document or varying or canceling an endorsement	made
upon  it  to  ""record in writing a brief  statement  of	 the
reasons	 for making such order and furnish to the holder  of
the passport or travel document on demand a copy of the same
unless,	 in  any  case, the passport  authority	 is  of	 the
opinion	 that  it  will	 not be	 in  the  interests  of	 the
soveriegnty  and integrity of India, the security of  India,
friendly  relations of India with my foreign country  or  in
the interests of the general public to furnish such a copy.""
It  was in virtue of the provision contained in	 the  latter
part  of  this	sub-section  that  the	Central	  Government
declined  to furnish a copy of the statement of reasons	 for
impounding the passport of the petitioner on the ground that
it was not in the interests of the general public to furnish
such  copy  to	the petitioner.	 It is indeed  a  matter  of
regret that the Central Government should have taken up this
attitude  in  reply to the request of the petitioner  to  be
supplied  a  copy  of  the  statement  of  reasons,  because
ultimately, when the petition came to be filed, the  Central
Government  did	 disclose the reasons in  the  affidavit  in
reply  to  the petition which shows that it was	 not  really
contrary  to public interest and if we look at	the  reasons
given  in the affidavit in reply, it will be clear  that  no
reasonable  person could possibly have taken the  view	that
the  interests of the general public would be prejudiced  by
the disclosure of the reasons.	This is an instance  showing
how power conferred on a statutory authority to act in	the,
interests of the general public can sometimes be  improperly
exercised.   If the petitioner had not filed  the  petition,
she would perhaps never have been able to find out what were
the reasons for which her passport was impounded and she was
deprived of her right to go abroad.  The necessity of giving
reasons has obviously been introduced in sub-section (5)  so
that  it may act as a healthy check against abuse or  misuse
of  power.  If the reasons given are not relevant and  there
is no nexus between the reasons and the ground on which	 the
passport has been impounded, it would be open to the  holder
of  the passport to challenge the order impounding it  in  a
court of law and if the court is satisfied that the  reasons
are extraneous or irrelvant, the court would strike down the
order.	 This liability to be exposed to  judicial  scrutiny
would by itself act as a safeguard against improper or	mala
fide exercise of power.	 The court would, therefore, be very
slow  to  accept, without close scrutiny, the claim  of	 the
passport authority that it would not be in the interests  of
the  general public to disclose the reasons.   The  passport
authority would have to satisfy the court by placing  proper
material  that	the giving of reasons would be	clearly	 and
indubitably against the interests of the general public	 and
if the Court is not so satisfied, the Court may require	 the
passport  authority to disclose the reasons, subject to	 any
valid and lawful claim for privilege which may be set up  on
behalf	of the Government.  Here in the present case, as  we
have  already  pointed	out,  the  Central  Government	 did
initially  claim that it would be against the  interests  of
the  general public to disclose the reasons  for  impounding
the  passport, but when it, came to filing the affidavit  in
reply,	the Central Government very properly abandoned	this
unsustainable  claim and disclosed the reasons The  question
whether	 these reasons have any nexus with the interests  of
the general public or they are extraneous and irrelevant  is
a matter

which  we shall examine when we deal with the  arguments  of
the parties, ,Meanwhile, proceeding further with the  resume
of the relevant provisions, reference may be made to section
11 which provides for an appeal inter alia against the order
impounding  or revoking a passport or travel document  under
sub-section  (3) of section 10.	 But there is a	 proviso  to
this  section  which says that if the  order  impounding  or
revoking  a  passport or travel document is  passed  by	 the
Central	 Government,  there  shall be no  right	 to  appeal.
These are the relevant provisions of the Act in the light of
which  we  have to consider the	 constitutionality  of	sub-
section (3) (c) of section 10 and the validity of the  order
impounding the passport of the petitioner.
Meaning and content of personal liberty in article 21
The  first contention urged on behalf of the  petitioner  in
support	 of the petition was that the right to go abroad  is
part  of  'personal  liberty  within  the  meaning  of	that
expression as used in Article 21 and no one can. be deprived
of  this right except according to the procedure  prescribed
by  law.  There is no procedure prescribed by  the  Passport
Act, 1967 for impounding or revoking a passport and  thereby
preventing the holder of the passport from going abroad	 and
in  any event, even if some procedure can be traced  in	 the
relevant  provisions of the Act, it  is	 unreasonable  and
arbitrary,  inasmuch  as it does not provide for  giving  an
opportunity  to	 the  holder of the  passport  to  be  heard
against the making of the order and hence the action of	 the
central	 Government  in	 impounding  the  passport  of	 the
petitioner  is in violation of Article 21.  This  contention
of  the	 petitioner  raises  a	question  as  to  the	true
interpretation of Article 21, what is the nature and  extent
of  the	 protection afforded by this article ? What  is	 the
meaning of 'personal liberty' : does it include the right to
go  abroad  so that this right cannot be abridged  or  taken
away  except in accordance with the procedure prescribed  by
law ? What is the inter-relation between Art. 14 and Article
21 ? Does Article 21 merely require that there Must be	some
semblance  of  procedure, howsoever arbitrary  or  fanciful,
prescribed  by	law before a person can be deprived  of	 his
personal liberty or that the procedure must satisfy  certain
requisites in the sense that it must be fair and  reasonable
?  Article 21 occurs in Part III of the	 Constitution  which
confers	 certain  fundamental  rights.	 These	 fundamental
rights had their roots deep in the struggle for independence
and,  as  pointed  out by Granville Austin  in	'The  Indian
Constitution-Cornerstone  of a Nation', ""they were  included
in the Constitution in the hope and expectation that one day
the  tree of true liberty would bloom in India"".  They	were
indelibly  written in the sub-conscious memory of  the	race
which fought for well-nigh thirty years for securing freedom
from  British rule and they found expression in the form  of
fundamental rights when the Constitution was enacted.  These
fundamental  rights represent the basic values cherished  by
the  people of this country since the Vedic times  and	they
are calculated to protect the dignity of the individual	 and
create conditions in which every human being can develop his
personality to the fullest extent.  They weave a ""pattern of
guarantees  on	the  basic-structure of	 human	rights""	 and
impose negative obligations on the State not to encroach  on
indi-

Gopalan's  case	 that certain articles in  the	Constitution
exclusively deal with specific matters cannot be accepted as
correct"". It was hold in R. C. Cooper's case and  that  is
clear from the judgment of Shah, J., because Shah, J., in so
many  terms  disapproved of the contrary  statement  of	 law
contained in the opinions of Kania, C. J., Patanjali Sastri,
J., Mahajan, J., Mukherjee, J., and S. R. Das, J., in A.  K.
Gopalan's  case	 that  even where a person  is	detained  in
accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, as mandated
by  Article 21,  the protection conferred  by	the  various
clauses	 of Article 19(1) does not cease to be available  to
him  and the law authorising such detention has	 to  satisfy
the test of the applicable freedom under Article 19,  clause
(1).  This would clearly show that Articles 19(1) and 21 are
not mutually exclusive, for, if they were, there would be no
question  of  a law depriving a person of  personal  liberty
within	the  meaning  of  Article 21  having  to  meet	 the
challenge  of  a  fundamental  right  under  Article  19(1).
Indeed,	 in that event, a law of preventive detention  which
deprives  a  person of 'personal liberty' in  the  narrowest
sense,	namely,	 freedom  from	detention  and	thus   falls
indisputably  within Art. 21 would not require to be  tested
on the touchstone of clause (d) of Article 19 (1) and yet it
was held by a Bench of seven Judges of this Court in Shambhu
Nath Sarkar v. The State of West Bengal& Ors. (1) that	such
a  law would have to satisfy the requirement inter  alia  of
Article	 19  (1),  clause (d) and in Haradhan  Saha  v.	 The
State, of West Bengal & Ors., (2) which was a decision given
by  a  Bench  of  five judges,	this  Court  considered	 the
challenge   of	 clause	 (d)  of  Article   19(1)   to	 the
constitutional	validity  of  the  Maintenance	of  Internal
Security  Act, 1971 and held that that Act did	not  violate
the  constitutional guarantee embodied in that article.	  It
is  indeed difficult to see on what principle we can  refuse
to  give  its  plain natural meaning  to  the  expression  '
personal  liberty'  as used in Article 21 and read it  in  a
narrow	 and  restricted  sense	 so  as	 to  exclude   those
attributes of personal liberty which are specifically  dealt
with  in Article 19.  We do not think that this would  be  a
correct	 way  of interpreting the provisions  of  the  Cons-
titution conferring fundamental rights.	 The attempt of	 the
court  should  be  to  expand the reach	 and  ambit  of	 the
fundamental  rights rather than attenuate their meaning	 and
content	 by  a process of judicial construction.   The	wave
length	for  comprehending  the	 scope	and  ambit  of	 the
fundamental  rights  has  been set by this Court  in  R.  C.
Cooper's case and our approach in the interpretation of	 the
fundamental  rights  must  now be in tune  with	 this  wave,
length.	  We  may point out even at the cost  of  repetition
that this Court has said in so; many terms in R. C. Cooper's
case  that each freedom has different dimensions  and  there
may be overlapping between different fundamental rights	 and
therefore  it  is  not a' valid argument  to  say  that	 the
expression  'personal  liberty'	 in Article 21	must  be  so
interpreted as to avoid overlapping between that article and
Article 19(1).	The expression 'personal liberty' in Article
21  is	of the widest amplitude and it covers a	 variety  of
rights	which go to constitute the personal liberty  of	 man
and some of them have been raised to the status of  distinct
fundamental  rights  and given additional  protection  under
Article 19.  Now, it has been

(2)  [1975] 1 S.C.R. 778.
671
held  by this Court in Satwant Singh's case  that  'personal
liberty'  within the meaning of Article 21  includes  within
its ambit the right to go abroad and consequently no  person
can be deprived of this right except according to  procedure
prescribed by law.  Prior to the enactment of the  Passports
Act, 1967, there was no law regulating the right of a person
to  go abroad and that was the reason why the order  of	 the
Passport   Officer  refusing  to  issue	 passport   to	 the
petitioner  in	Satwant	 Singh's case  was  struck  down  as
invalid.   It  win  be seen at once  from  the	language  of
Article 21 that the protection it secures is a limited	one.
It  safeguards	the  right to go  abroad  against  executive
interference  which  is not supported by law; and  law	here
means 'en-. acted law' or 'State Law'.	Vide A. K. Gopalan's
case.	Thus, no person can be deprived of his right to,  go
abroad	unless there is a law made by the State	 prescribing
the  procedure for so depriving him and the  deprivation  is
effected strictly in accordance with such procedure.  It was
for this reason, in order to comply with the requirement  of
Article 21, that Parliament enacted the Passports Act,	1967
for regulating the tight to go abroad.	It is clear from the
provisions of the Passports, Act, 1967 that is lays down the
circumstances  under  which  a passport	 may  be  issued  or
refused	 or  cancelled or impounded and	 also  prescribes  a
procedure for doing so, but the question is whether that  is
sufficient compliance with Article 21.	Is the	prescription
of  some  sort	of procedure enough or	must  the  procedure
comply	 with  any  particular	requirements  ?	  Obviously,
procedure cannot be arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable.	This
indeed was conceded by the learned Attorney General who with
his  usual candour frankly stated that it was  not  possible
for  him to contend that any procedure howsoever  arbitrary,
oppressive  or unjust may be prescribed by the	law.   There
was some discussion in A. K. Gopalan's case in regard to the
nature	of  the procedure required to  be  prescribed  under
Article 21 and at least three of the learned Judges out  of
five  expressed	 themselves strongly in favour of  the	view
that  the  procedure cannot be any arbitrary,  fantastic  or
oppressive procedure.  Fazal Ali, J., who was in a minority,
went to the farthest limit in saying that the procedure must
include the four essentials, set out in Prof.  Willi's	book
on  Constitutional  Law, namely, notice, opportunity  to  be
heard, impartial tribunal and ordinary course of  procedure.
Patanjali  Sastri, J. did not go as far as that but  he	 did
say  that ""certain basic principles emerged as the  constant
factors	 known to all those procedures and they	 formed	 the
core of the procedure established by law."" Mahajan, J., also
observed that Article 21 requires that ""there should be some
form  of proceeding before a person can be condemned  either
in respect of his life or his liberty"" and ""it negatives the
idea  of  fantastic,  arbitrary	 and  oppressive  forms	  of
proceedings"". But apart altogether from these	observations
in  A. K. Gopalan's case, which have great weight,  we	find
that even on principle the concept of reasonableness must be
projected  in  the procedure contemplated  by  Article 21,,
having regard to the impact of Article 14 on Article 21.

judges	of this Court in Khudiram Das v. The State  of	West
Bengal	 &  Ors.(1)  Interestingly,  even  prior  to   these
decisions, as pointed out by Dr. Rajive Dhawan, in his	book
: ""The Supreme Court of India :"" at page 235, reference	 was
made,  by this court in Mohd.  Sabir v. State of  Jammu	 and
Kashmir(2)  to article 191(2) to justify preventive;  deten-
tion.	The  law, must, therefore, now be taken to  be	well
settled that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19 and that
even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving
a person of 'personal liberty' and there is consequently  no
infringement  of the fundamental right conferred by  Article
21,  such  law, in so far as it abridges or takes  away	 any
fundamental  right under Article 19 would have to  meet	 the
challenge  of that article. This proposition can no  longer
be  disputed  after the decisions in R.	 C.  Cooper's  case,
Shambhu	 Nath Sarkar's case and Haradhan Saha's case.	Now,
if  a  law  depriving a person	of  'personal  liberty'	 and
prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the  meaning
of  Article 21 has to stand the test of one or more  of	 the
fundamental  rights conferred under Article 19 which may  be
applicable  in a given situation, ex hypothesi it must	also
be  liable to be tested with reference to Article 14. This
was in fact not disputed by the learned Attorney General and
indeed	he  could  not	do  so in  view	 of  the  clear	 and
categorical  statement	made  by Mukharjea,  J.,  in  A.  K.
Gopalan's case that Article 21 ""presupposes that the law  is
a  valid  and  binding	law  under  the	 provisions  of	 the
Constitution   having  regard  to  the	competence  of	 the
legislature  and  the  subject it relates to  and  does	 not
infringe   any	 of  the  fundamental	rights	 which	 the
Constitution  provides	for"", including	 Article  14. This
Court  also  applied  Article  14  in  two  of	its  earlier
decisions,  namely,  The State of West Bengal v.  Anwar	 Ali
Sarkar(3)   and	  Kathi	 Raning	 Rawat	v.  The	  State	  of
Saurashtra(4)  where there was a special law  providing	 for
trial  of certain offences by a speedier process which	took
away  some of the safeguards available to an  accused  under
the ordinary procedure in the Criminal Procedure Code. The
special	 law  in each of these two cases  undoubtedly  pres-
cribed	a procedure for trial of the specified offences	 and
this  procedure could not be condemned as inherently  unfair
or unjust and there was thus compliance with the requirement
of Article 21, but even so, the validity of the special	 law
was  tested before the Supreme, Court on the  touchstone  of
Article	 14  and in one case, namely, Kathi  Raning  Rawat's
case,  the  validity was upheld and in	the  other,  namely,
Anwar Ali Sarkar's case, it was struck down.  It was held in
both  these  cases  that the procedure	established  by	 the
special	 law must not be violative of the  equality  clause.
That procedure must answer the requirement of Article 14.

affidavit, Government  has not	put  to	 the  best  use	 the
finances and  resources available to it. There is a wide gap
between the  demand and	 supply in the area of housing which
was in the neighbourhood of forty five thousand units in the
decade 1971-81.	 A huge	 amount of  hundreds  of  crores  of
rupees shall  have to be found by the State Government every
year during  the  period  of  the  Sixth  Plan	if  adequate
provision for  housing is  at all to be made. The Urban Land
Ceiling Act  has not  achieved its desired objective nor has
it been	 properly implemented. The employment schemes of the
State Government  are like  a drop in the ocean and no steps
are taken  for increasing  Job opportunities  in  the  rural
sector. The  neglect  of  health,  education  transport	 and
communication in  that sector  drives the  rural folk to the
cities, not  only in search of a living but in search of the
basic  amenities  of  life.  The  allegation  of  the  State
Government  regarding	the  criminal  propensities  of	 the
pavement dwellers  is stoutly  denied in the reply-affidavit
and it	is said	 to be	contrary  to  the  studies  of	many
experts. Finally,  it is  stated that  it is  no longer	 the
objective of the Sixth Plan to reverse the rate of growth of
metropolitan cities.  The  objective  of  the  earlier	plan
(1978-83) has  undergone a significant change and the target
now is	to ensure the growth of large metropolitan cities in
a  planned  manner.  The  affidavit  claims  that  there  is
adequate land  in the Bombay metropolitan region to absorb a
population of  20 million  people, which  is expected  to be
reached by the year 2000 A.D.
     The  arguments   advanced	before	 us  by	 Ms.  Indira
Jaisingh, Mr.  V.M. Tarkunde  and Mr. Ram Jethmalani cover a
wide range but

the main  thrust of the petitioners' case is that evicting a
pavement dweller or slum dweller from his habitat amounts to
depriving of  his right to livelihood, which is comprehended
in the	right guaranteed  by Article 21 of the Constitution
that  no  person  shall	 be  deprived  of  his	life  except
according to  procedure established  by law. The question of
the guarantee  of personal  liberty contained  in Article 21
does not arise and was not raised before us. Counsel for the
petitioners contended that the Court must determine in these
petitions the  content of the right to life, the function of
property in  a welfare state, the dimension and true meaning
of the	constitutional mandate	that property  must subserve
common good,  the sweep of the right to reside and settle in
any part  of the  territory of	India which is guaranteed by
Article 19(1)(e)  and the  right to carry on any occupation,
trade or  business which is guaranteed by Article 19 (1)(g),
the competing  claims of  pavement dwellers  on the one hand
and of the pedestrians on the other and, the larger question
of ensuring equality before the law. It is contended that it
is the	responsibility of  the courts to reduce inequalities
and  social  imbalances	 by  striking  down  statutes  which
perpetuate them.  One of  the grievances  of the petitioners
against the  Bombay Municipal  Corporation Act, 1888 is that
it is  a century  old antiquated piece of legislation passed
in an  era when	 pavement dwellers and slum dwellers did not
exist and  the consciousness  of  the  modern  notion  of  a
welfare state  was not	present to  the mind of the colonial
legislature. According	to the	petitioners, connected	with
these issues and yet independent of them, is the question of
the role  of the  Court in  setting the	 tone of values in a
democratic society.



     As we  have stated	 while summing	up the	petitioners'
case, the  main plank of their argument is that the right to
life which is guaranteed by Article 21 includes the right to
livelihood  and	 since,	 they  will  be	 deprived  of  their
livelihood if  they are evicted from their slum and pavement
dwellings, their  eviction is  tantamount to  deprivation of
their life  and is  hence unconstitutional.  For purposes of
argument, we  will assume  the factual	correctness  of	 the
premise that  if the  petitioners  are	evicted	 from  their
dwellings, they	 will be  deprived of their livelihood. Upon
that assumption,  the question	which we have to consider is
whether the  right to life includes the right to livelihood.
We see	only one  answer to  that question,  namely, that it
does. The sweep of the right to life conferred by Article 21
is wide	 and far reaching. It does not mean merely that life
cannot be extinguished or taken away as, for example, by the
imposition and	execution  of  the  death  sentence,  except
according to  procedure established  by law. That is but one
aspect of  the right  to life. An equally important facet of
that right is the right to livelihood because, no person can
live without  the means	 of living,  that is,  the means  of
livelihood. If	the right  to livelihood is not treated as a
part of the constitutional right to life, the easiest way of
depriving a person his right to life would be to deprive him
of his	means of livelihood to the point of abrogation. Such
deprivation would  not only denude the life of its effective
content and meaningfulness but it would make life impossible
to live. And yet, such deprivation would not have to

be in  accordance with	the procedure established by law, if
the right  to livelihood  is not  regarded as  a part of the
right to  life. That, which alone makes it possible to live,
leave aside what makes life livable, must be deemed to be an
integral component of the right to life. Deprive a person of
his right  to livelihood  and you shall have deprived him of
his life. Indeed, that explains the massive migration of the
rural population  to big  cities. They	migrate because they
have no	 means of  livelihood in  the villages.	 The  motive
force which  people their  desertion of	 their	hearths	 and
homes in  the village s that struggle for survival, that is,
the struggle  for life.	 So unimpeachable is the evidence of
the nexus  between life	 and the  means of  livelihood. They
have to eat to live: Only a handful can afford the luxury of
living to  eat. That  they can do, namely, eat, only if they
have the  means of  livelihood. That is the context in which
it was	said by	 Douglas J. in Baksey that the right to work
is the	most  precious	liberty	 because,  it  sustains	 and
enables a  man to  live and  the right to life is a precious
freedom. ""Life"",  as  observed	by  Field,  J.	in  Munn  v.
Illinois, (1877) 94 U.S. 113, means something more than mere
animal existence  and the inhibition against the deprivation
of life	 extends to  all those limits and faculties by which
life is	 enjoyed. This	observation was quoted with approval
by this Court in Kharak Singh v. The State of U.P., [1964] 1
S.C.R. 332.



     Learned  counsel  for  the	 respondents  placed  strong
reliance on  a decision	 of this  Court in  In Re: Sant Ram,
[1960] 3 S.C.R. 499, in support of their contention that the
right to  life guaranteed by Article 21 does not include the
right to  livelihood. Rule  24 of  the Supreme	Court  Rules
empowers the  Registrar to  publish lists of persons who are
proved to  be habitually  acting  as  touts.  The  Registrar
issued a  notice to  the appellant  and one  other person to
show cause  why their  names should  not be  included in the
list of	 touts. That  notice was challenged by the appellant
on the ground, inter alia, that it contravenes Article 21 of
the Constitution  since, by the inclusion of his name in the
list of	 touts, he  was deprived of his right to livelihood,
which is  included in  the right  to life.  It was held by a
Constitution Bench  of	this  Court  that  the	language  of
Article 21 cannot be pressed in aid of the argument that the
word `life'  in Article 21 includes `livelihood' also. This
decision is distinguishable because, under the Constitution,
no person  can claim  the right to livelihood by the pursuit
of  an	opprobrious  occupation	 or  a	nefarious  trade  or
business, like	tourism, gambling  or living on the gains of
prostitution. The  petitioners before  us do  not claim	 the
right to  dwell on  pavements or in slums for the purpose of
pursuing any  activity which is illegal, immoral or contrary
to public  interest. Many  of them  pursue occupations which
are humble but honourable.



     Two conclusions  emerge from this discussion: one, that
the right  to life which is conferred by Article 21 includes
the right to livelihood and two, that it is established that
if the	petitioners are	 evicted from  their dwellings, they
will be	 deprived of  their livelihood. But the Constitution
does not  put an absolute embargo on the deprivation of life
or personal  liberty. By Article 21, such deprivation has to
be according to procedure established by law. In the instant
case, the  law which  allows the  deprivation of  the  right
conferred by  Article 21 is the Bombay Municipal Corporation
Act, 1888, the relevant provisions of which are contained in
Sections 312(1),313(1)(a)  and	314.  These  sections  which
occur in  Chapter XI  entitled `Regulation  of Streets' read

Article 22,"A.K. Gopalan vs The State Of Madras.Union Of India: ... on 19 May, 1950",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1857950/?formInput=Article%2022,,"(b) the maximum period for which any person may ,in	 any
class or classes of cases be detained under any law  provid-
ing for preventive detention;  and
    (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in
an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4).""
    The learned Attorney-General contended that the  subject
of preventive detention does not fall under

article	 21  at	 all and is covered wholly  by	article 22.
According  to  him,  article 22 is a complete  code.   I  am
unable	to  accept that contention.  It is obvious  that  in
respect	 of  arrest  and detention article 22  (1)  and	 (2)
provide	 safeguards.  These safeguards are excluded  in	 the
case  of preventive detention by article 22 (3),  but  safe-
guards	in  connection with such detention are	provided  by
clauses	 (4)  to (7) of the same article.  It  is  therefore
clear  that  article 21 has to be read	as  supplemented  by
article 22. Reading in that way the proper mode of construc-
tion will be that to the extent the procedure is  prescribed
by article 22 the same is to be observed; otherwise  article
21  will  apply.  But if certain procedural  safeguards	 are
expressly  stated  as  not required, or	 specific  rules  on
certain	 points of procedure are prescribed,  it  seems	 im-
proper	to interpret these points as not covered by  article
22 and left open for consideration under article 21. To	 the
extent	 the  points  are  dealt  with,	  and  included	  or
excluded,, article 22 is a complete code.  On the points  of
procedure  which expressly or by necessary  implication	 are
not  dealt with by article 22, the operation of	 article  21
will remain unaffected.	 It is thus necessary first to	look
at  article 22 (4) to (7) and next at the provisions  0	 the
impugned  Act to determine if the Act or any of	 its  provi-
sions  are ultra vires.	 It may be noticed that neither	 the
American  nor the Japanese Constitution	 contain  provisions
permitting  preventive	detention,. much  less	laying	down
limitations  on	 such right of detention, in  normal  timeS,
i.e., without a declaration of emergency.  Preventive deten-
tion  in  normal times,. i.e., without the existence  of  an
emergency  like	 war,. is recognised as a  normal  topic  of
legislation  in List I. Entry 9, and List III, Entry  3,  of
the  Seventh Schedule.	Even in the Chapter  on	 Fundamental
Rights	article 22 envisages legislation in respect of	pre-
ventive detention in normal times. The provisions of article
22  (4)	 to (7) by their very wording leave  unaffected	 the
large  powers  of legislation on this  point  and  emphasize
particularly  by article 22 (7) the power of the  Parliament
to  deprive a person of a right to have his case  considered
by an advisory	board.	Part III and.



 Article 22 (4) opens with a double negative.  Put in  a
positive  form	it will mean that a law which  provides	 for
preventive  detention for a period longer than three  months
shall  contain .a provision establishing an advisory  board,
(consisting of persons with the qualifications mentioned  in
sub-clause (a)), and which has to report before the  expira-
tion of three months if in its opinion there was  sufficient
cause for such detention. This clause, if it stood by itself
and  without  the remaining provisions of article 22,	will
apply  both  to the Parliament and the	State  Legislatures.
The proviso to this clause further enjoins that even  though
the  advisory  board may be of the opinion  that  there	 was
sufficient cause for such detention, i.e., detention  beyond
the period of three months, still the detention is not to be
permitted  beyond the maximum period, if any, prescribed  by
Parliament under article 22 (7) (b). Again the whole of this
sub-clause  is	made inoperative by article 22	(4)  (b)  in
respect of an Act of preventive detention passed by  Parlia-
ment  under clauses (7) (a) .and (b).  Inasmuch as  the	 im-
pugned	Act is an Act of the Parliament purported to  be  so
made, clause 22 (4) has no operation and may for the present
discussion  be kept aside. Article 22 prescribes  that	when
any person under a preventive detention law is detained, the
authority making the order shall, as soon as may be,  commu-
nicate	to such person the grounds on which . the order	 has
been made and shall afford him the

earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.	This  clause is of general operation in	 respect  of
every  detention order made under any law permitting  deten-
tion.  Article 22 (6) permits the authority making the order
to withhold disclosure of facts which such authority consid-
ers  against  the public interest to disclose.	 It  may  be
noticed that this clause only permits the non-disclosure  of
facts,	and reading clauses (5) and (6) together a  distinc-
tion  is  drawn	 between facts	and  grounds  of  detention.
Article 22 (4) and (7) deal not with the period of detention
only  but with other requirements in the case of  preventive
detention  also.  They provide for the establishment  of  an
advisory  board, and the necessity of furnishing grounds  to
the detenue and also to give him a right to make a represen-
tation.	 Reading article 22 clauses (4) and (7) together  it
appears	 to  be implied that preventive detention  for	less
than three months, without  an advisory board, is  permitted
under  the  Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights,  provided	such
legislation  is	 within the legislative	 competence  of	 the
Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be.
    Article 22	 (5) permits the detained person to  make  a
representation.	 The Constitution is silent as to the person
to  whom it has to be made, or how it has to be dealt  with.
But that is the procedure laid down by the Constitution.  It
does not therefore mean that if a law made by the Parliament
in  respect of preventive detention does not make  provision
on those two points it is invalid.  Silence on these  points
does  not  make	 the impugned Act in  contravention  of	 the
Constitution  because  the first question is  what  are	 the
rights	given by the Constitution in the case of  preventive
detention. The contention that the representation should  be
to  an	outside	 body has no support in law.   Even  in	 the
Liversidge  case  the representation had to be made  to	 the
Secretary  of  State and not to another	 body.	 After	such
representation	was  made,  another advisory  board  had  to
consider it, but it was not necessary to make the  represen-
tation	itself	to a third party.  Article 22  (4)  and	 (7)
permit the non-establishment of an advisory board  expressly
in a  parliamentary  legislation-



 Section  7 of the Act which is next challenged, runs  on
the same lines as article 22 (5) and. (6) and in my  opinion
infringes  no provision of the Constitution. It	 was  argued
that  this  gave only the right of making  a  representation
without being heard 'orally or without affording an opportu-
nity  to  lead	evidence and therefore was  not	 an  orderly
course	of  procedure, as required by the rules	 of  natural
justice.   The Parliament by the Act has expressly  given  a
right  to the person detained under a  preventive  detention
order  to  receive the grounds for detention  and  also	 has
given  him  a right to make a representation.  The  Act	 has
thus complied with the requirements of article 22 (s).	That
clause,	 which prescribes what procedure has to be  followed
as a matter of fundamental right, is silent about the person
detained having a right to be heard

orally or by a lawyer.	The Constituent Assembly had  before
them the provisions of clause (1) of the same article.	 The
Assembly  having  dealt with the requirements  of  receiving
grounds	 and giving an opportunity to make a  representation
has  deliberately  refrained from providing a  right  to  be
heard orally.  If so, I do not read the clause as guarantee-
ing such right under article 22 (5).  An ""orderly course  of
procedure"" is not limited to procedure which has been  sanc-
tioned	by  settled usage.  New forms of  procedure  are  as
much, held even by the Supreme Court of America, due process
of  law	 as old forms, provided they give a  person  a	fair
opportunity to present his case.  It was contended that	 the
right to make a representation in article 22 (5) must  carry
with  it  a right to be heard by  an  independent  tribunal;
otherwise  the making of a representation has  no  substance
because it is not an effective remedy.	I am unable to	read
clause	(5) of .article 22 as giving a fundamental right  to
be  heard  by  an independent  tribunal.   The	Constitution
deliberately  stops at giving the right	 of  representation.
This is natural because under article 22 (7), in terms,	 the
Constitution  permits the making of a law by  Parliament  in
which  a reference to an advisory board may be omitted.	  To
consider  the right to make a representation as	 necessarily
including  a right to be heard by an  independent  judicial,
administrative or advisory tribunal will thus be directly in
conflict with the express words of article 22 (7).
    Even according to the Supreme Court of U.S.A. a right to
a  judicial trial is not absolute.  In the United States  v.
Ju Toy (1), a question arose about the exclusion from  entry
into the States, of a Chinese who claimed to be a citizen of
the  United States.  At page 263 the majority judgment	con-
tains  the  following  passage :--"" If for  the	 purpose  of
argument,  we  assume that the Fifth  Amendment	 applies  to
him,   and that to deny entrance to a citizen is to  deprive
him  ,of liberty, we nevertheless are of opinion  that	with
regard	to him due process of law does not require  judicial
trial: That is the result of the cases which we have  cited,
and the almost necessary result of the
  (1) (198) U.S. 253 at 263.



    Dealing with the four fundamental principles of  natural
justice	 in procedure claimed by the petitioner, it is	thus
clear that in respect of preventive detention no question of
an objective standard of human conduct can be laid down.  It
is  conceded that no notice before detention can be  claimed
by  the	 very nature of such detention.	 The  argument	that
after  detention intimation of the grounds should  be  given
has  been recognised in article 22 (5) and  incorporated  in
the	impugned   Act.	 As regards an	impartial  tribunal,
article 22 and	 (7)  read  together give  the	  Parliament
ample  discretion.   When  in  specified  circumstances	 and
classes	 of cases the preventive  detention  exceeds   three
months,	 the absence of an advisory board is expressly	per-
mitted

by  article 22 (7). Under article 22 (4) it appears  implied
that  a provision for such tribunal is not necessary if	 the
detention  is  for less than three months.   As	 regards  an
opportunity to be heard, there is no absolute natural  right
recognised  in respect of oral representation.	It has	been
held  to depend on the nature of the tribunal. The right  to
make  a	 representation is affirmed by the  Constitution  in
article 22 (5) and finds a place in the impugned Act.	 The
right to an orderly course of procedure to the extent it  is
guaranteed  by article 22 (4) read with article 22 (7)	(c),
and  by	 article 22  (7) (a) and (b), has  also  been	thus
provided   in  the  Act.   It seems to me therefore that the
petitioner's contentions even on these points fail.
    Section  14 was strongly attacked on the ground that  it
violated  all  principles of natural justice  and  even	 in-
fringed	 the right given by article 22 (5) of the  Constitu-
tion.  It runs as follows:",
Article 22,Constitution of India,https://indiankanoon.org/doc/237570/,,,
Article 22,"Mrs. Maneka Gandhi vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Anr. on 25 January, 1978",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/43475503/?formInput=Article%2022,,"8. Fazal Ali, J., however, said (at p. 148) :
 To my mind, the scheme of the Chapter dealing with the fundamental rights does not contemplate what is attributed to it, namely, that each article is a code by itself and is independent of the others. In my opinion, it cannot be said that Articles 19, 20, 21 and 22 do not to some extent overlap each other. The case of a person who is convicted of an offence will come under Article 20 and 21 and also under Article 22 so far as his arrest and detention in custody before trial are concerned. Preventive detention, which is dealt with in Article 22, also amounts to deprivation of personal liberty which is referred to in Article 21, and is a violation of the right of freedom of movement dealt with in Article 19(1)(d). That there are other instances of overlapping of articles in the Constitution may be illustrated by reference to Article 19(1)(f) and Article 31 both of which deal with the right to property and to some extent overlap each other.



10. In A. K. Gopalan's case (supra), what was at issue was whether the tests of valid procedure for deprivation of personal liberty by preventive detention must be found exclusively in Article 22 of the Constitution or could we gather from outside it also elements of any ""due process of law"" and use them to test the validity of a law dealing with preventive detention. Our Constitution makers, while accepting a departure from ordinary norms, by permitting making of laws for preventive detention without trial for special reasons in exceptional situations also provided quite elaborately, in Article 22 of the Constitution itself, what requirements such law, relating to preventive detention, must satisfy. The procedural requirements of such laws separately formed parts of the guaranteed fundamental rights. Therefore, when this Court was called upon to judge the validity of provisions relating to preventive detention it laid down, in Gopalan's case (supra), that the tests of ""due process"", with regard to such laws, are to be found in Article 22 of the Constitution exclusively because this article constitutes a self-contained code for laws of this description. That was, in my view, the real ratio decidendi of Gopalan's case (supra). It appears to me, with great respect, that other observations relating to the separability of the subject matters of Articles 21 and 19 were mere obiter dicta. They may have appeared to the majority of learned Judges in Gopalan's case to be extensions of the logic they adopted with regard to the relationship between Article 21 and 22 of the Constitution. But, the real issue there was whether, in the face of Article 22 of the Constitution, which provides all the tests of procedural validity of a law regulating preventive detention, other tests could be imported from Article 19 of the Constitution or elsewhere into ""procedure established by law"". The majority view was that this could not be done. I think, if I may venture to conjecture what opinions learned Judges of this Court would have expressed on that occasion had other types of law or other aspects of personal liberty, such as those which confronted this Court in either Satwant Singh's case (supra) or Kharak Singh's case (supra) were before them, the same approach or the same language would not have been adopted by them. It seems to me that this aspect of Gopalan's case (supra) is important to remember if we are to correctly understand what was laid down in that ease.



11. I have already referred to the passages I cited in A. D. M. Jabalpur's case (supra) to show that, even in Gopalan's case (supra), the majority of judges of this Court took the view that (the ambit of personal liberty protected by Article 21 is wide and comprehensive. It embraces both substantive rights to personal liberty and the procedure provided for their deprivation. One can, however, say that no question of ""due process of law"" can really arise, apart from procedural requirements of preventive detention laid down by Article 22, in a case such as the one this Court considered in Gopalan's case (supra). The clear meaning of Article 22 is that the requirements of. ""due process of law"", in cases of preventive detention, are satisfied by what is provided by Article 22 of the Constitution itself. This article indicates the pattern of ""the procedure established by law"" for cases of preventive detention,



12. Questions, however, relating to either deprivation or restrictions of personal liberty, concerning laws falling outside Article 22 remained really unanswered, strictly speaking, by Gopalan's case. If one may so put it, the field of ""due process"" for cases of preventive detention is fully covered by Article 22, but other parts of that field, not covered by Article 22, are ""unoccupied"" by its specific provisions. I have no doubt that, in what may be called ""unoccupied"" portions of the vast sphere of personal liberty, the substantive as well as procedural laws made to cover them must satisfy the requirements of both Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.",

We  find   considerable	  difficulty   in   accepting	this
submission. Earlier  in this  judgment, we  have upheld	 the
validity of section 1(2) of the 44th Amendment Act, by which
the Parliament has given to the Central Government the power
to bring  into force  all or  any of  the provisions of that
Act,  with   option  to	 appoint  different  dates  for	 the
commencement of different provisions of the Act. The Central
Government has	brought	 all  the  provisions  of  the	44th
Amendment Act  into force  except one,	namely,	 section  3,
which  contains	  the  provision  for  the  constitution  of
Advisory Boards.  We have  taken the  view  that  we  cannot
compel the Central Government by a writ of mandamus to bring
the provisions of section 3 into force. We have further held
that, on  a true  interpretation of  Article 368(2)  of	 the
Constitution, it is in accordance with the terms of the 44th
Constitution Amendment	Act that,  upon the President giving
his assent  to that  Act, the  Constitution  stood  amended.
Since section  3 has  not been	brought into  force  by	 the
Central Government  in the  exercise  of  its  powers  under
section 1(2)  of the  44th Amendment  Act, that	 section  is
still not  a part  of the  Constitution. The  question as to
whether section	 9 of  the National  Security Act is bad for
the reason  that it  is inconsistent  with the provisions of
section 3  of the  44th Amendment  Act, has  therefore to be
decided on  the basis  that section  3, though a part of the
44th Amendment Act, it is not a part of the Constitution. If
section 3 is not a part of the Constitution, it is difficult
to appreciate  how the validity of section 9 of the National
Security Act  can be  tested by	 applying the  standard laid
down in	 that section.	lt cannot  possibly be that both the
unamended and the amended provisions of Article 22(4) of the
Constitution are  parts of  the Constitution  at one and the
same time So long as section 3 of the 44th Amendment Act has
not been  brought into force, Article 22(4) in its unamended
form will  continue to	be a part of the Constitution and so
long as	 that provision	 is part  of the  Constitution,	 the
amendment introduced  by section 3 of the 44th Amendment Act
cannot become  a part of the Constitution. Section 3 of 44th
Amendment substitute a new Article 22(4) for the old Article
22(4). The  validity of	 the constitution of Advisory Boards
has therefore  to be  tested in	 the light of the provisions
contained  in  Article 22(4)  as  it  stands  now  and	 not
according to  the amended  Article 22(4).  According to that
Article as  it stands  now, an Advisory Board may consist of
persons, inter	alia, who  are qualified  to be appointed as
Judges of  a High  Court. Section 9 of the National Security
Act provides  for the constitution of the Advisory Boards in
conformity with	 that provision.  We find  it impossible  to
hold,

that the  provision of	a statute,  which conforms  strictly
with the  existing provisions  of the  Constitution, can  be
declared bad  either on	 the ground  that it does not accord
with the  provisions of a constitutional amendment which has
not yet come into force, or on the ground that the provision
of the	section is  harsh or  unjust The  standard which the
Constitution, as  originally enacted,  has itself  laid down
for constituting Advisory Boards, cannot be characterised as
harsh or  unjust. The argument, therefore, that section 9 of
the National Security Act is bad for either of these reasons
must fail.



     Turning first  to the  right  of  legal  representation
which is claimed by the petitioners, the relevant article of
the Constitution  to consider  is Article 22 which bears the
marginal note  ""protection against  arrest and	detention in
certain cases.""	 That article provides by clause (l) that no
person who  is arrested shall be detained in custody without
being informed,	 as soon  as may be, of the grounds for such
arrest nor  shall he  be denied the right to consult, and to
be defended  by, a  legal practitioner of his choice. Clause
(2) requires  that every person who is arrested and detained
in custody  shall be  produced before the nearest magistrate
within a period of 24 hours

Of such	 arrest and  that no  person shall  be	detained  in
custody A  beyond the said period without the authority of a
magistrate. Clause  (3) provides that nothing in clauses (1)
and (2) shall apply (a) to any person who for the time being
is an  enemy alien;  or (b) to any person who is arrested or
detained under	any law	 providing for preventive detention.
It may	be recalled  that clause 4(a) of Article 22 provides
that no	 law of	 preventive detention  shall  authorise	 the
detention of  a person for a period longer than three months
unless the  Advisory Board has reported before the expiry of
the said period of three months that there is in its opinion
sufficient cause  for such  detention.	By  clause  7(c)  of
Article 22,  the Parliament  is given the power to prescribe
by law the procedure to be followed by the Advisory Board in
an inquiry under clause 4(a).



     On a  combined reading  of clauses	 (1) and  (3) (b) of
Article 22,  it is clear that the right to consult and to be
defended by  a legal  practitioner of one's choice, which is
conferred by  clause (1),  is denied  by clause	 3(b)  to  a
person	who   is  detained   under  any	 law  providing	 for
preventive  detention.	 Thus,	according   to	the  express
intendment of  the Constitution	 itself, no  person  who  is
detained  under	 any  law,  which  provides  for  preventive
detention,  can	  claim	 the   right  to   consult  a  legal
practitioner of his choice or to be defended by him. In view
of  this,   it	seems  to  us  difficult  to  hold,  by	 the
application of	abstract, general  principles or on a priori
considerations that  the  detenu  has  the  right  of  being
represented by	a  legal  practitioner	in  the	 proceedings
before	the  Advisory  Board,  Since  the  Constitution,  as
originally enacted,  itself contemplates  that such  a right
should not  be made available to a detenu, it cannot be said
that the  denial of  the said  right is	 unfair,  unjust  or
unreasonable. It  is indeed  true to say, after the decision
in the Bank Nationalisation case, that though the subject of
preventive detention  is specifically  dealt with in Article
22, the	 requirements of  Article 21 have nevertheless to be
satisfied. It  is therefore  necessary	that  the  procedure
prescribed by  law for	the proceedings	 before the Advisory
Boards must  be fair,  just and	 reasonable. But  then,	 the
Constitution  itself   has  provided  a	 yardstick  for	 the
application of	that standard,	through the  medium  of	 the
provisions contained  in Article 22(3)(b). Howsoever much we
would have  liked to  hold otherwise,  we experience serious
difficulty in  taking the  view that  the procedure  of	 the
Advisory Boards	 in which  the detenu is denied the right of
legal representation  is unfair	 unjust or  unreasonable. If
Article 22 were

silent on the question of the right of legal representation,
it would  have been  possible, indeed  right and  proper, to
hold that  the detenu  cannot be  denied the  right of legal
representation	in   the  proceedings  before  the  Advisory
Boards. It  is unfortunate that courts have been deprived of
that choice by the express language of Article 22(3)(b) read
with Article 22(1).



     It is  contended by  Shri Jethmalani that the provision
contained hl  clause 3(b)  of Article 22 is  limited to the
right which  is specifically conferred by clause (1) of that
article and  therefore, if the right to legal representation
is available  to the  detenu apart  from the  provisions  of
Article 22(1),	that right cannot of denied to him by reason
of the exclusionary provision contained in Article 22(3)(b).
Counsel says  that the	right of legal representation arises
out of	the provisions	of Articles  19 and 21 and 22(5) and
therefore, nothing  said in Article 22(3)(b) can affect that
right. In  a sense  we have already answered this contention
because, what  that contention implies is that the denial of
the right  of legal  representation to	the  detenu  in	 the
proceedings before  the Advisory  Board is  an	unreasonable
restriction, within  the meaning  of Article  19(1), on	 the
rights conferred  by  that  article.  If  the  yardstick  of
reasonableness is  provided by	Article 22(3),	which is  as
much a	part of	 the Constitution  as originally enacted, as
Articles 19,  21 and  22(S), it	 would be  difficult to hold
that the  denial  of  the  particular  right  introduces  an
element of unfairness, unjustness or unreasonableness in the
procedure of the Advisory Boards. It would be stretching the
language of Articles 19 and 21 a little too far to hold that
what is	 regarded as  reasonable by Article 22(3)(b) must be
regarded  as   unreasonable  within  the  meaning  of  those
articles. For  illustrating this  point,  we  may  take	 the
example of  law which  provides that an enemy alien need not
be produced  before a magistrate within twenty-four hours of
his  arrest  or	 detention  in	custody.  If  the  right  of
production before  the magistrate  within 24  hours  of	 the
arrest is  expressly denied  to the  enemy alien  by Article
22(3)(a), it would be impossible to hold that the said right
is nevertheless available to him by reason of the provisions
contained in  Article 21.  The reason is, that the answer to
the question  whether the  procedure established  by law for
depriving an  enemy alien of his personal liberty is fair or
just is	 provided by  the Constitution	itself	through	 the
provisions  of	 Article 22(3)(a).   What  that   provision
considers fair, just and reasonable cannot, for the purposes
of Article 21, be regarded as unfair unjust or unreasonable.",
Article 22,"K.M. Abdulla Kunhi And B.L. Abdul Khader vs Union Of India And Ors., State Of ... on 23 January, 1991",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1355334/?formInput=Article%2022,,"There are two constitutional safeguards, namely, clause
(4) of Article 22, and clause (5) of Article 22.  the former
requires  that	if a detenu is liable to be detained  for  a
longer period than three months, his case shall be  referred
to   the  Advisory  Board  which  must	report	before	 the
expiration of the said period of three months that there  is
in  its	 opinion sufficient cause for such  detention.	 The
function  of  the Board is purely advisory  and	 its  report
will enable the Government to detain the person beyond three
months	provided  the detention is valid on its	 merits	 and
does not otherwise offend the Constitution.   Clause (5)  of
Article 22  provides that when any person  is	detained  in
pursuance  of  an order made under any	law  providing	 for
preventive  detention the authority making the order  shall,
as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on
which  the  order  has been made and shall  afford  him	 the
earliest opportunity of making a representation against	 the
order.



						     110
 Section 10 prescribes the maximum period for which	 any
person	may be detained.  Section 11 provides power  to	 the
State  Government  or the Central Government to	 revoke	 the
detention  order  without  prejudice to	 the  provisions  of
Section 21 of the General Clauses Act. This revocation shall
not bar the making of another detention order under  section
3 against the same person.
     It	 is  now  beyond the pale of  controversy  that	 the
constitutional right to make representation under clause  (5)
of  Article 22	 by  necessary	implication  guarantees	 the
constitutional	 right to a proper  consideration   of	 the
representation.	 Secondly, the obligation of the  Government
to   afford   to   the	detenu	an   opportunity   to	make
representation	and  to	 consider  such	 representation	 is
distinct from the Government's obligation to refer the	case
of  detenu  along with the representation  to  the  Advisory
Board to enable it to form its opinion and send a report  to
the  Government.   It is implicit in clauses (4) and (5)  of
Article 22 that the Government while discharging its duty to
consider the representation, cannot depend upon the views of
the  Board  on such representation.  It has to consider	 the
representation	on its own without being influenced  by	 any
such view of the Board.	 The obligation of the Government to
consider the representation is different from the obligation
of  the Board to consider the representation at the time  of
hearing	 the  references.   The	 Government  considers	 the
representation to ascertain essentially whether the order is
in  conformity with the power under the law.  The Board,  on
the other hand, considers the representation and the case of
the  detenu to examine whether there is sufficient case	 for
detention.  The consideration by the Board is an  additional
safeguard  and	not a substitute for consideration  of	the
representation	by  the Government.  The right to  have	 the
representation considered by the Government, is, safeguarded
by  cl.	 (5)  of Article 22 and it  is	independent  of	 the
consideration of the detenu's case and his representation by
the  Advisory  Board  under cl. (4) of	Art.  22  read	with
section	 8(c)  of the Act. (See: Sk. Abdul Karim &  Ors.  v.
State  of  West	 Bengal,  [1969] 1  SCC	 433;  Pankaj  Kumar
Chakrabarty  &	Ors. v. State of west Bengal, [1970]  1	 SCR

     The  representation  relates  to  the  liberty  of	 the
individual, the highly cherished right enshrined in  Article
21 of our Constitution.
					     111
Clause (5) of Article 22 therefore, casts a legal obligation
on the Government to consider the representation as early as
possible.  it  is a constitutional  mandate  commanding	 the
concerned   authority  to  whom	 the  detenu   submits	 his
representation to consider the representation and dispose of
the  same as expeditiously as possible.	 The words ""as	soon
as may be"" occuring in clause (5) of Article 22 reflects the
concern	 of the Framers that the representation	  should  be
expeditiously  considered  and disposed of with a  sense  of
urgency	 without an avoidable delay.  However, there can  be
no  hard  and fast rule in this regard it depends  upon	 the
facts  and circumstances of each case.	There is  no  period
prescribed  either  under  the	Constitution  or  under	 the
concerned  detention  law, within which	 the  representation
should	be  dealt with.	 The requirement  however,  is	that
there should not be supine indifference slackness or callous
attitude in considering the representation.  Any unexplained
delay in the disposal of representation would be a breach of
the  constitutional  imperative	 and  it  would	 render	 the
continued  detention  impermissible and illegal.   This	 has
been  emphasised and re-emphasised by a series of  decisions
of  the	 Court.	 (See: Jayanarayan Sukul v.  State  of	West
bengal,	 {1970]	 1 SCC 219; Frances Coralie Mullin  v.	W.C.
Kambra	and  Ors., [1980] 2 SCC 275; Rama Dhondu  Borade  v.
V.K.  Saraf, Commissioner of Police and Ors., [1989]  3	 SCC
173 and Aslam Ahmed Zahire Ahmed Shaik v. Union of India and
ors., [1989] 3 SCC 277.



     It is necessary to mention that with regard to  liberty
of  citizen  the  Court	 stands guard  over  the  facts	 and
requirement  of	 law,  but  Court  cannot  draw	 presumption
against any authority without material.	 It may be borne  in
mind  that the confirmation of detention does  not  preclude
the  Government	 from revoking the order of  detention	upon
considering  the  representation.  Secondly,  there  may  be
cases	where	the   Government   has	 to   consider	 the
representation only after confirmation of detention.  Clause
(5) of Article 22 suggests that the representation could  be
received even after confirmation of the order

of  detention.	 The words 'shall afford  him  the  earliest
opportunity of making a representation against the order'  in
clause (5) of Article 22 suggest that the obligation of	 the
Government is to offer the detenu an opportunity of making a
representation	against	 the order, before it  is  confirmed
according to the procedure laid down under Section 8 of	 the
Act.  But if the detenu does not exercise his right to	make
representation	at  that  stage,  but  presents	 it  to	 the
government  after the Government has confirmed the order  of
detention,  the	 Government  still  has	 to  consider	such
representation	and release the detenu if the  detention  is
not  within  the  power conferred under	 the  statute.	 The
confirmation  ofthe order of detention is not conclusive  as
against	 the  detenu.	It can be  revoked  suo	 motu  under
Section 11 or upon a representation of the detenu.  It seems
to  us	therefore,  that so long as  the  representation  is
independently  considered by the Government and if there  is
no  delay in considering the representation, the  fact	that
it  is considered after the confirmation of detention  makes
little	difference  on	the validity  of  the  detention  or
confirmation  of the detention.	 The confirmation cannot  be
invalidated solely on the ground that the representation  is
considered subsequent to confirmation of the detention.	 Nor
it  could  be  presumed that such consideration	 is  not  an
independent  consideration.   With all respect, we  are	 not
inclined  to subscribe to the views expressed in V.J.  Jain.

considered to be good law and hence stand overruled.",
Article 22,"Haradhan Saha & Another vs The State Of West Bengal & Ors on 21 August, 1974",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1486034/?formInput=Article%2022,,"The petitioners contend that Article 21 is violated  because
a detenu is not given the right to be heard on all facts and

The  petitioners contend that Article 22 is violated by	 the
Act  because it does not provide for impartial and  judicial
consideration of, the representation by the Government.	 The
Act  merely  reproduces	 the language of  Article 22  which
creates a fetter on the power GI the legislature.  This	 Act

19.
This Court in A. K. Gopalan v. The State of Madras [1950] S.
C. R 88 held that Article 22 is a complete code and  Article
19  is not invoked in those cases. It is now said that	 the
view  in  Gopalan's case (supra) no longer holds  the  field
after the decision in the Bank Nationalisation case [1970] 3
S.C.R.	530.  In the Bank Nationalisation case (supra)	this
Court  held that Article 31(2) is not a complete  protection
for acquisition of property by the two tests of authority of
law  and  compensation.	  This Court said  that	 the  direct
impact	of such an act of acquisition might  invade  rights,
under  Article 19, and, therefore, the acquisition could  be
tested as to whether it was a reasonable restriction on	 the
rights guaranteed under Article 19. Article 19(1)(f)  deals
with the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property.  It
is apparent that after a person's property has been acquired
by the State he cannot acquire, hold or dispose of the	same
property.   In the Bank Nationalisation case (supra)  it  is
said  that the acquisition which left the Banks free  to  do
business  other than banking was rendered  unreasonable	 by,
reason	of  the Banks being deprived of the  wherewithal  to
carry  on the business.	 The right guaranteed under  Article
19(1)(g) to carry on any occupation, trade or business	were
therefore held to be directly invaded by the nationalisation
of   Banks.    It  is  in  this	 context   that	  the	Bank
Nationalisation	 case (supra) held that in spite of  Article
31(2). the acquisition of property directly impinged on	 the
right  of the Banks to carry on business other than  Banking
guaranteed

under	Article	 19(1)(g)  and	Article	 31(2)	was  not   a
protection against infringement of that guaranteed right.
We  may proceed on the assumption that the Act which is	 for
preventive  detention  may  be tested  with  regard  to	 its
reasonableness	with reference to Article 19. Section 3  of
the  Act  is  to  be interpreted in  the  light	 of  various
existing Statutes which deal with the various acts mentioned
in  section  3.	 Acts sought to be prevented  are  found  in
various legislations like the Essential Commodities Act, the
Essential Services Act.	 It is not necessary that the person
to  be detained should have actually committed a crime or  a
forbidden act.	In some cases the person who has not already
committed  a  crime is likely to commit an  act	 to  prevent
which  section	3 provides for detention of such  a  person.
Some  times  it	 may be possible that an act  which  is	 not
forbidden  by  law may fall within the ambit of	 section  3,
Such  cases  may  be dealing with relations  of	 India	with
foreign powers or maintenance of public order,
The Preventive Detention Act of 1950 was considered by	this
Court  and. it is an established rule of this Court  that  a
detenu	has a right to be apprised of all the  materials  on
which the order of detention is based or approved.  The only
exception  is as provided in clauses (6) and (8) of  Article
22 where it is not necessary to disclose facts which may  be
considered to be against the public interest to disclose.
The  representation of a detenu is to be considered.   There
is   an	  obligation   on  the	 State	 to   consider	 the
representation.	  The Advisory Board has adequate  power  to
examine	 the entire materials.	The Board can also call	 for
more  materials.   The	Board may call	the  detenu  at	 his
request.  The constitution of the Board shows that it is  to
consist	 of Judges or persons qualified to be Judges of	 the
High  Court.   The constitution of the	Board  observes	 the
fundamental  of	   fair	 play  and  principles	of,  natural
justice.  It is not the requirement of principles of natural
justice	 that there must be an oral hearing.  Section  8  of
the  Act which casts an obligation on the State to  consider
the  representation affords the detenu all the rights  which
are  guaranteed by Article 22(5).  The Government  considers
the  representation  to ascertain  essentially	whether	 the
order  is in conformity with the power under the  law.	 The
Board, on the other hand, considered whether in the light of
the representation there is sufficient cause for detention.
The representation is to be considered by the Advisory Board
by  following the substance of natural justice as far as  it
is  consistent	with  the nature of the	 impugned  Act,	 the
nature of the relative juris  diction of the Government	 and
of  the	 Advisory  Board.   Procedural	reasonableness	 for
natural justice flows from Article 19. Article 22(5) speaks
of  liberty  and  making of  representation.   The  combined
result	of clauses (4), (5) and (6) of Article 22 is that  a
procedure which 4-L192Sup.Cl 75

permits	 representation will give all the facts	 before	 the
Board.	 Article 22(5) shows that law as  to  detention  is
necessary.  The requirements of that law are to be found  in
Article 22. Article 22 gives the mandate as to  what	will
happen in such circumstances.



The  opinion  of  the  Board as well as	 the  order  of	 the
Government  rejecting the representation of the detenu	must
be after proper consideration.	There need not be a speaking
order.	There is also no failure of justice by the order not
being a speaking order.	 All that is necessary is that there
should be a real and proper consideration by the  Government
and the Advisory Board.
Section	 14 of the Act clothes the authority with the  power
of  revoking or modifying the detention order at  any  time.
Such a power which is for the benefit of the detenu  carries
with it the duty to exercise that power whenever and as soon
as  changed  or new factors call for the  exercise  of	that
power.	 This  shows that the authorities can  consider	 new
factors	 or changed circumstances.  This Court	has  already
held  in Fagu Shaw etc. v. State of West Bengal A.I.R.	1974
S.C. 613 that when Parliament prescribed two years or  until
the expiry of the Defence of India Act, whichever is  later,
it satisfied the requirements of Article 22(7)(b) of  fixing
the  maximum  period.	The further  requirement  of  a	 six
monthly review as contended for by the petitioners  suggests
a new provision.  That does not go to reasonableness but  to
policy of legislature and due process of law.
Section 8 of the Act follows the provisions of Article 22(5)
of  the	 Constitution.	 Article 22(5)	 enjoins  upon	 the
detaining authority obligation to afford the detenu earliest
opportunity  of making a representation against	 the  order.
An opportunity of making a representation cannot be  equated
with  an  opportunity of oral hearing or  hearing  before  a
Court and the procedure of judicial trial.  As long as there
is an opportunity to make a representation against the order
of  detention  and  a  long as a  representation  is  to  be
considered    by   the	 Advisory   Board   there   is	  no
unreasonableness  in regard to the procedure.  The  duty  to
consider the representation does not mean a personal hearing
or  the	 disclosure of reasons.	  Procedural  reasonableness
which is invoked by the petitioners cannot have any abstract
standard  or general pattern of reasonableness.	 The  nature
of  the	 right	infringed, the	underlying  purpose  of	 the
restrictions  imposed,	the extent and urgency of  the	evil
sought	to  be remedied there by, the disproportion  of	 the
imposition,  the  prevailing  conditions at  the  time,	 all
provide	 the basis for considering the reasonableness  of  a
particular provision.  The procedure embodied in the Act has
to be judged in the context of the urgency and the magnitude
of  the problem, the underlying purpose of the	restrictions
and the prevailing conditions.



Elaborate  rules  of  natural justice  are  excluded  either
expressly  or  by  necessary  implication  where  procedural
provisions  are made in the statute or where disclosure,  of
relevant  information  to  an  interested  party  would	  be
contrary  to the public interest.  If a statutory  provision
excludes the   application  of any or all the principles  of
natural justice then the Court	does not  completely  ignore
the mandate of the legislature.	   The	Court  notices	 the
distinction between the duty to act	fairly and a duty to
art  judicially	 in accordance with  natural  justice.	 The
detaining   authority	is  under  a  duty  to	 give	fair
consideration  to the representation made by the detenu	 but
it  is	not  under  a duty to disclose	to  the	 detenu	 any
evidence  or  information.   The  duty	to  act	 fairly	  is
discharged  even it there is not an oral bearing.   Fairness
denotes abstention from abuse of discretion.
Article 22 which provides for preventive detention lays down
substantive  limitations as well as  procedural	 safeguards.
The  principles	 of natural justice in so far  as  they	 are
compatible  with  detention laws find place  in	 Article 22
itself and also in the Act.  Even if Article 19 be  examined
in  regard to preventive detention it does not increase	 the
content of reasonableness required to be observed in respect
of orders of preventive detention.  The procedure in the Act
provides  for  fair  consideration  to	the  representation.
Whether in a particular case, a detenu has not been afforded
an  opportunity	 of making a representation or	whether	 the
detaining  authority is abusing the powers of detention	 can
be brought before the Court of Law.",

these  documents were considered by the Detaining Authority,
as  set	 out  in  paras	 13, 14 and 15	of  the	 grounds  of
detention  (reproduced above), but copies of those documents
were  not  supplied  to the detenu with the result  that  an
effective opportunity of hearing, as contemplated by Article
22(5)  of  the	Constitution,  was   not  provided  and	 the
detention order, for this reason, stands vitiated.

detention  of Bham Faisal Gulam Mohammed was necessary, were
supplied  to him.  It is only when he has looked into  those
documents, read and understood their contents that it can be
said that the detenu can make an effective representation to
the  Detaining	Authority, State or Central  Government,  as
laid  down  in	Article 22 (5) of  the	 Constitution  which
provides as under :



      The  words ""grounds"" used in clause (5) of Article 22
means  not  only the narration or conclusions of facts,	 but
also all materials on which those facts or conclusions which
constitute  ""grounds""  are based.  In Prakash Chandra  Mehta

1986 SC 687 = (1985) Supp.

      SCC 144 = (1985) 3 SCR 697, in which an order of

      detention was passed under Section 3 (1) of the

      Conservation of Foreign Exchange & Prevention of

      Smuggling Activities Act, this Court, while examining

      the  concept  of	""grounds""  used	 in  Article 22(5),
observed

      that   the   word	  ""grounds""   has  to	receive	  an
interpretation

      which would keep it meaningfully in tune with the

      contemporary notions.  It was explained that the

      expression ""grounds"" includes not only conclusions of

      facts but also all the ""basic facts"" on which those

      conclusions were founded.	 The ""basic facts"" are

      different	  from	 subsidiary	facts	or   further
particulars.



      The order of detention, in the instant case, is

      based only on one ground which is to the effect that

      Bham Faisal Gulam Mohammed was, on 10.8.1997, held at

      the  Mumbai Airport and on his search being taken,  he
was

      found in possession of Diamonds which he was trying to

      smuggle out of India.

      As pointed out earlier, copies of the documents

      which  were  seized on a search made at  premises	 No.
B/13,

      Sikkanagar, V.P.	Road, Mumbai-400 004, admittedly

      considered  by the Detaining Authority, were not given
to

      Bham Faisal Gulam Mohammed.  On a perusal of the

      documents referred to in the grounds of detention, the

      Detaining	 Authority  had come to the conclusion	that
Bham

      Faisal Gulam Mohammed was acting as a ""carrier"" for

      persons who were the king-pins, financiers and

      organisers of the whole smuggling activities.  This

      inference was drawn by the Detaining Authority on the

      basis  of the documents referred to in grounds 13	 and


      of the detention order.  The Bombay High Court, before

      which  the  question  of non-supply of  documents	 was
raised

      and the order of detention was challenged on grounds,

      inter  alia, that requirements of Article 22 (5)	were
not

      complied with, relied upon the affidavit of the

      Detaining Authority and found that the documents

      referred to in Paras 13 and 14 of the grounds were not

      to  be  supplied	to  the	 detenu	 and  there  was  no
infraction

      of sub-clause (5) of Article 22 of the Constitution.",

Personal liberty is one of the most cherished freedoms, perhaps more
important than the other freedoms guaranteed under the Constitution. It was
for this reason that the Founding Fathers enacted the safeguards in Article
22 in the Constitution so as to limit the power of the State to detain a
person without trial, which may otherwise pass the test of Article 21, by
humanising the harsh authority over individual liberty. Since, preventive
detention is a form of precautionary state action, intended to prevent a
person from indulging in a conduct injurious to the society or the security
of State or public order, it has been recognised as ""a necessary evil"" and
is tolerated in a free society in the larger interest of security of State
and maintenance of public order. However, the power being drastic, the
restric-tions placed on a person to preventively detain must, consistently
with the effectiveness of detention, be minimal. In a democracy governed by
the Rule of Law, the drastic power to detain a person without trial for
security of the State and/or maintenance of public order, must be strictly
construed. This Court, as the guardian of the Constitution, though not the
only guardian, has zealously attempted to preserve and protect the liberty
of a citizen. However, where individual liberty comes into conflict with an
interest of the security of the State or public order, then the liberty of
the individual must give way to the larger interest of the nation.



It would be relevant at this stage to notice the provisions of Article
22(4) (a) and (7) of the Constitution.

Article 22(4) (a) of the Constitution provides as follows :

""22 (4)(a) - an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been,
or are qualified to be appointed as, judges of a High Court has reported
before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in
its opinion sufficient cause for such detention :

Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorise the detention of
any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by
Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause (7).""



(c)    the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry
under sub-clause (a) of clause (4)."" A combined reading of Clauses (4) and
(7) makes it clear that if a law made by Parliament or the State
Legislature authorises the detention of a person for a period not exceeding
three months, it does not have to satisfy any other constitutional
requirement except that it must be within the legislative competence of the
Parliament or the State Legislature, as the case may be. (Article 246,
Entry 9, List I and Entry 3, List-Ill of Seventh Schedule). The
Constitution itself permits the parliament and the State Legislature to
make law providing for detention, without trial upto a period of three
months without any safeguards but where the law seeks to provide for
detention for a longer period than three months, it must comply with the
constitutional safeguards which are found in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of
Clause (4), though leaving it to the discretion of the detaining authority
to decide what should be the maximum period of detention. Outside limit to
the period of detention has, however, been laid down by the proviso which
says that nothing in sub-clause (a) of Clause (4) shall authorise the
detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law
made by Parliament under Clause (7). The question whether Parliament is
itself bound to prescribe the maximum period of detention under Article
22(7) (b) of the Constitution in order that the proviso to Article 22(4)(e)
might operate, is no longer res-Integra. The issue was considered by a
Constitution Bench of this Court in Fagu Shaw, Etc. Etc. v. The State of
West Bengal, [1974] 2 S.C.R. 832, and authoritatively answered. Since, I
respectfully agree with the answer, I need not detain myself to deal with
that issue any further.



It was contended by the learned Attorney General that Section 10 and
particularly the words 'may be detained' have to be read in the context of
Article 22(7)(b) of the Constitution and if they are so read, also keeping
in mind the object and purpose of the Act, then correctly interpreted they
would mean 'may be actually detained'. He submitted that Article 22(7)(b)
is permissive, it being not obligatory on Parliament to prescribe the
maximum period of detention. Mr. Harish N. Salve, learned Solicitor General
appearing for the State of Gujarat, also submitted that the Constitution
thus contemplates longer period of detention in the sense that in absence
of any limit prescribed by the Parliament detention can be for a period
longer than one or two years. It is true that Article 22(7) (b) has been
held permissive and, therefore, there can be a preventive detention
legislation which does not provide for the maximum period of detention and
a person can be detained thereunder for a period longer than one or two
years. That, however, cannot justify the view that the provision
prescribing maximum period of detention should be construed liberally. When
the Parliament has chosen to fix the maximum period, the question as to how
the said period is to be computed will have to be decided by considering
the object of the legislation and the relevant provision, the words used in
that provision and without being influenced by the nature of power
conferred by Article 22(7)(b). COFEPOSA, like all other preventive
detention laws, has been regarded as a Draconian Law as it takes away the
freedom and liberty of the citizen without a trial and on mere suspicion.
It is tolerated in a democracy governed by the rule of law only as a
necessary evil. Though the object of such legislation is to protect the
nation and the society against anti national and anti social activities,
the nature of action permitted is preventive and not punitive. The
distinction between preven-live detention and punitive detention has now
been well recognized. Preventive detention is qualitatively different from
punitive detention/sen-tence. A person is preventively detained without a
trial but punitive deten-tion is after a regular trial and when he is found
guilty of having committed an offence. The basis of preventive detention is
suspicion and its justifica-tion is necessity. The basis of sentence is the
verdict of the Court after a regular trial. When a person is preventively
detained his detention can be justified only so long as it is found
necessary. When a person is sentenced to suffer imprisonment it is intended
that the person so sentenced shall remain in prison for the period stated
in the order imposing sentence. The term specified in the order of sentence
is intended to be actual period of imprisonment. On the other hand,
preventive detention being an action of immediate necessity has to be
immediate and continuous if it is to be effective and the purpose of
detention is to be achieved. The safeguards available to a person against
whom an order of detention has been passed are limited and, therefore, the
Courts have always held that all the procedural safeguards provided by the
law should be strictly complied with. Any default in maintaining the time
limit has been regarded as having the effect of rendering the detection
order or the continued detention, as the case may be, illegal. The
justification for preventive detention being necessity a person can be
detained only so long as it is found necessary to detain him. If his
detention is found unnecessary, even during the maximum period permissible
under the law then he has to be released from detention forthwith. It is
really in this context that section 10 and particularly the words 'may be
detained' shall have to be interpreted.",

discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is
under the management of a minority, whether based on religion,
community or language"".

On 8.12.1948, the aforesaid draft Article 23 was placed before the
Constituent Assembly.  When draft Article 23 was taken up for debate, Shri
M. Ananthasayanam Ayyangar stated that for the words ""no minority""
occurring in clause 2 of draft Article 23, the words "" no citizen or minority""



My submission is that considering the matter from all the
standpoints, this amendment is one which should be accepted unanimously
by this House"".

After Dr. B.R. Ambedkar gave clarification as to why the words ""no
minority"" were deleted and its place ""no section of the citizen"" were
substituted in clause (1) of Draft Article 23.	Amendment as proposed by
Shri Thakur Dass Bhargava was put to motion and the same was adopted.
Thus the word 'minority' was deleted and the same was substituted by the
word 'citizen' and for the words ""religion, community or language"", the
words ""religion, race, caste, language or any of them"" were substituted.
Thus, Article 23 was split into two Articles - Article 23 containing clause (1)
and clause (2) of Article 23 and sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (3) of
Article 23 was numbered as Article 23-A.    Subsequently Articles 23 and
23-A became Articles 29 and 30, respectively.  Thus, Article 23, as
amended, became part of the Constitution on 9th December, 1948.



	The deliberations of the Constituent Assembly show that initially Shri
K.M. Munshi recommended that citizens belonging to national minority in
the State whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other
citizens in setting up and administering at their own expense charitable,
religious and social institutions, schools and other educational
establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their
religion for being incorporated in the proposed Constitution of India.	This
was with a view that the members of the majority community who are more
in number may not at any point of time take away the rights of minorities to
establish and administer educational institution of their choice.  It was very
much clear that there was a clear intention that the rights given to minorities
under Article 30(1) were to be exercised by them if the institution
established is administered at their own cost and expense.  It is for that
reason we find that no educational institution either minority or majority has
any common law right or fundamental right to receive financial assistance
from the government.  Non-discriminatory clause (2) of Article 30 only
provides that the State while giving grant-in-aid to the educational
institutions shall not discriminate against any educational institution on the
ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether based on
religion or language. The subsequent deliberations of the Constituent
Assembly further shows that there was thinking in the minds of the framers
of the Constitution that equality and secularism be given paramount
importance while enacting Article 30(1).  It is evident that amendment
proposed by Shri Thakur Dass Bhargava which is now Article 29(2) was a
conscious decision taken with due deliberations.  The Constituent Assembly
was of the view that originally clause (2) of draft Article 23 sought to
distinguish the minority from majority, whereas in the chapter the words are
'cultural and educational rights' and as such the word 'minority' ought not
to have found place in that Article.  The reason for omission of words in
clause (2) of draft Article 23 was that minorities were earlier given certain
rights under that clause where national interest required that no member of
majority also should be discriminated against in educational matters.  It also
shows that by the aforesaid amendment discrimination between minority and
majority was done away with and the amendment has brought the minority
and majority in equal footing.	The debate also shows what was originally
proposed either in clause 18(2) or Art. 23(2).	The debate further shows that
the post partition stage members of the Constituent Assembly intended to
broaden the scope of clause (2) of draft Article 23 and never wanted to
confine the rights only to the minorities.  The views of the members of the
Constituent Assembly were that if any institution takes aid from the
government for establishing and administering educational institutions it
cannot discriminate while admitting students on the ground of religion, race
and caste.  It may be seen that by accepting the amendment proposed by Shri
Thakur Dass Bhargava, the scope of Article 29(2) was broadened inasmuch
as the interest of minority - either religious or linguistic was secured and,
therefore, the intention of the framers of the Constitution for enacting  clause
(2) of Article 29(2) was that once a minority institution takes government
aid, it becomes subject to clause (2) of Article 29.



	It was then urged that if the intention of the framers of the
Constitution was to make Article 30(1) subject to Article 29(2), the
appropriate place where it should have found place was Article 30(1) itself
rather than in Article 29 and, therefore, Article 29(2) cannot be treated as an
exception to article 30(1).  There is no merit in the contention.  It is earlier
noticed that clause (18) when was placed before the Constituent Assembly
contained the provisions of Article 29(1)(2) and 30(1)(2) and  all were
numbered as clause 18(1) (2) (3)(a) (b).  Again when clause (18) was
transposed in draft Article 23, Article 29(1)(2) and Article 30(1)(2)  both
were together in draft Article 23.  Shri Thakur Dass Bhargava's amendment
which was accepted was in relation to clause (2) of Article 23	which
ultimately has become Article 29(2).  It is for that reason Article 29(2) finds
place in Article 29.",
Article 23,"People'S Union For Democratic Rights ... vs Union Of India & Others on 18 September, 1982",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/496663/?formInput=Article%2023,,"Now many  of the  fundamental rights  enacted  in  Part	 III
operate as  limitations on the power of the State and impose
negative  obligations  on  the	State  not  to	encroach  on
individual liberty and they are enforceable only against the
State. But there are certain fundamental rights conferred by
the Constitution  which are  enforceable against  the  whole
world and they are to be found inter alia in Articles 17, 23
and 24.	 We have  already discussed the true scope and ambit
of Article  24 in  an earlier  portion of  this judgment and
hence we  do not  propose to  say anything more about it. So
also we	 need not expatiate on the proper meaning and effect
of the	fundamental right  enshrined in	 Article 17 since we
are not	 concerned with	 that Article  in the  present	writ
petition. It  is Article 23 with which we are concerned and
that Article  is clearly  designed to protect the individual
not only  against the  State but  also against other private
citizens. Article 23 is  not  limited	in  its	 application
against the  State but it prohibits ""traffic in human beings
and  begar   and  other	 similar  forms	 of  forced  labour""



     When the  Constitution makers  enacted Article 23 they
had before  them Article  of the  Universal  Declaration  of
Human  Rights	but  they  deliberately	 departed  from	 its
language and  employed words  which would make the reach and
content of  Article 23 much wider than- that of Article 4 of
the Universal  Declaration  of	Human  Rights.	They  banned
'traffic in  human beings  which is  an expression  of	much
larger	amplitude   than  ""slave   trade""  and	 they	also
interdicted  ""begar   and  other  similar  forms  of  forced
labour"". The  question is what is the scope and ambit of the
expression 'begar  and other  similar forms of forced labour
?""  In	 this  expression   wide  enough  to  include  every
conceivable form of forced labour and what is the true scope
and meaning of the words ''forced labour ?"" The word 'begar'
in this	 Article is  not a  word of  common use	 in  English
language. It  is a  word of  Indian origin  which like	many
other words  has found its way in the English vocabulary. It
is very	 difficult to  formulate a precise definition of the
word begar'  but there	can be no doubt that it is a form of
forced labour  under which  a person  is compelled  to	work
without receiving  any	remuneration.  Molesworth  describes
'begar' as  ""labour or	service exacted	 by a  government or
person	in   power  without  giving  remuneration  for	it.""
Wilson's glossary  of Judicial	and Revenue  Terms gives the
following meaning  of the  word 'begar': ""a forced labourer,
one pressed to carry burthens for individuals or the public.
Under the  old system,	when pressed  for public service, no
pay was given. The Begari, though still liable to be pressed
for public  objects, now  receives pay:	 Forced	 labour	 for
private service	 is prohibited.""  ""Begar"" may  therefore  be
loosely described  as labour  or service  which a  person is
forced to  give without	 receiving any remuneration for 'it.
That was  the meaning  of the  word 'begar'  accepted  by  a
Division Bench

of the	Bombay High  Court in S. Vasudevan v. S.D. Mital.(1)
'Begar' is  thus clearly  a film of forced labour. Now it is
not merely 'begar' which is unconstitutionally prohibited by
Article 23  but also  all  other  similar  forms  of  forced
labour. This  Article strikes  at forced  labour in whatever
form it	 may manifest  itself, because	it is  violative  of
human dignity  and is  contrary to  basic human	 values. The
practice of  forced labour  is	condemned  in  almost  every
international instrument  dealing with	human rights.  It is
interesting to find that as far back as 1930 long before the
Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights  came	into  being,
International Labour  organisation adopted Convention No. 29
laying down  that every	 member of  the International Labour
organisation which  ratifies this convention shall ""suppress
the use of forced or compulsory labour in all its forms"" and
this  prohibition  was	elaborated  in	Convention  No.	 105
adopted by  the International  Labour organisation  in 1957.
The words ""forced or compulsory labour"" in Convention No. 29
had of	course a  limited meaning but that was so on account
of the restricted definition of these words given in Article
2 of the Convention. Article 4 of the European Convention of
Human Rights  and Article 8 of the International Covenant on
Civil  and   Political	Rights	 also  prohibit	  forced  or
compulsory labour.  Article 23	is in the same strain and it
enacts a  prohibition against forced labour in whatever form
it may	be found. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of
the respondent	laid some emphasis on the word 'similar' and
contended that	it is  not every form of forced labour which
is prohibited  by Article 23 but  only such  form of forced
labour as  is similar  to 'begar'  and since  'begar'  means
labour or  service which  a person is forced to give without
receiving any  remuneration for it, the interdict of Article
23 is  limited only  to those  forms of	 forced labour where
labour or  service is  exacted from  a person without paying
any remuneration  at all  and if  some remuneration is paid,
though it  be inadequate, it would not fall within the words
'other similar forms of forced labour. This contention seeks
to unduly  restrict  the  amplitude  of	 the  prohibition  .
against forced	labour enacted	in Article 23 and is in our
opinion not  well founded. It	does  not  accord  with	 the
principle enunciated by this Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union
of India(2)  that when	interpreting the  provisions of	 the
Constitution conferring	 fundamental rights,  the attempt of
the court  should be  to expand	 the reach  and ambit of the
fundamental rights rather than to attenuate their
     (1) AIR 1962 Bom. 53:

meaning and  content. It  is difficult	to imagine  that the
Constitution makers  should have  intended to strike only at
certain forms  of forced  labour  leaving  it  open  to	 the
socially or  economically powerful sections of the community
to exploit  the poor  and weaker  sections by  resorting  to
other forms  of forced	labour. Could  there be any logic or
reason in enacting that if a person is forced to give labour
or service  to another without receiving any remuneration at
all  it	  should  be   regarded	 as  a	pernicious  practice
sufficient to attract the condemnation of Article 23, but if
some remuneration  is paid for it, then it should be outside
the inhibition	of that	 Article ?  If this  were  the	true
interpretation, Article 23 would  be reduced to a mere rope
of sand,  for it  would then  be the  easiest  thing  in  an
exploitative society for a person belonging to a socially or
economically dominant  class to exact labour or service from
a person belonging to the deprived and vulnerable section of
the community  by paying a negligible amount of remuneration
and thus escape the rigour of Article 23. We do not think it
would be  right to  place on  the language  of Article 23 an
interpretation	which	would  emasculate   its	  beneficent
provisions and	defeat the very purpose of enacting them. We
are clear of the view that Article 23 is intended to abolish
every form  of forced labour. The words ""other similar forms
of forced  labour are  used in Article 23 not with a view to
importing the  particular  characteristic  of  'begar'	that
labour or  service should  be exacted without payment of any
remuneration but  with a  view to  bringing within the scope
and ambit  of that  Article all other forms of forced labour
and  since  'begar'  is	 one  form  of	forced	labour,	 the
Constitution makers  used the  words ""other similar forms of
forced labour.""	 If the	 requirement  that  labour  or	work
should be  exacted without any remuneration were imported in
other forms of forced labour, they p would straightaway come
within the  meaning of	the word  'begar' and  in that event
there would  be no  need to have the additional words ""other
similar forms  of  forced  labour.""  These  words  would  be
rendered futile	 and meaningless and it is a well recognised
rule  of  interpretation  that	the  court  should  avoid  a
construction which as the effect of rendering any words used
by the	legislature superfluous	 or redundant. The object of
adding these  words was	 clearly to  expand  the  reach	 and
content of  Article 23 by including, in addition to 'begar',
other forms  of forced labour within the prohibition of that
Article. Every	form of	 forced labour 'begar' or otherwise,
is within  the inhibition  of Article 23 and  it  makes  no
difference whether the per-



491
provide labour	or service  against his will, even though it
be under a contract of service.
     Now the  next question that arises for consideration is
whether there  is any  breach of  Article 23  when a  person
provides labour	 or service  to the  State or  to any  other
person and  is paid less than the minimum wage for it. It is
obvious that ordinarily no one would willingly supply labour
or service  to another	for less than the minimum wager when
he knows  that under  the law  he is entitled to get minimum
wage for  the labour  or service  provided by  him.  It	 may
therefore  be  legitimately  presumed  that  when  a  person
provides labour	 or service  to another	 against receipt  of
remuneration which  is less  than the  minimum wage,  he  is
acting under  the force	 of some compulsion which drives him
to work	 though he  is paid  less than	what he	 is entitled
under law  to receive.	What Article 23 prohibits is 'forced
labour' that  is labour	 or service which a person is forced
to provide  and 'force'	 which would  make  such  labour  or
service 'forced labour' may arise in several ways. It may be
physical force	which may  compel a person to provide labour
or service  to another	or it may be force exerted through a
legal provision such as a provision for imprisonment or fine
in case	 the employee  fails to provide labour or service or
it may	even be	 compulsion arising from hunger and poverty,
want and  destitution. Any factor which deprives a person of
a choice  of alternatives  and	compels	 him  to  adopt	 one
particular course  of action  may properly  be	regarded  as
'force' and if labour or service is compelled as a result of
such 'force', it would we 'forced labour'. Where a person is
suffering  from	  hunger  or  starvation,  when	 he  has  no
resources at  all to  fight disease  or feed  his  wife	 and
children or  even  to  hide  their  nakedness,	where  utter
grinding poverty  has broken  his back	and reduced him to a
state  of  helplessness	 and  despair  and  where  no  other
employment is  available to  alleviate	the  rigour  of	 his
poverty, he would have no choice but to accept any work that
comes hims  way, even  if the remuneration offered to him is
less than  the minimum	wage. He  would be in no position to
bargain with  the employer;  he would have to accept what is
offered to  him. And in doing so he would be acting not as a
free agent  with a choice between alternatives but under the
compulsion of  economic	 circumstances	and  the  labour  or
service provided  by him  would be  clearly 'forced labour.'
There is no reason why the word 'forced' should be read in a
narrow and

restricted manner  so as  to be confined only to physical or
legal 'force'  particularly when  the national	charter, its
fundamental document  has promised  to build a new socialist
republic where	there will  be socioeconomic justice for all
and every one shall have the right to work, to education and
to adequate  means of  livelihood. The	constitution  makers
have given  us one  of	the  most  remarkable  documents  in
history for  ushering in  a new socio-economic order and the
Constitution which  they have  forged for  us has  a  social
purpose and  an economic mission and therefore every word or
phrase in  the Constitution  must be interpreted in a manner
which would  advance the  socio-economic  objective  of	 the
Constitution. It  is not  unoften that in capitalist society
economic circumstance  exert much  greater  pressure  on  an
individual in  driving him  to a particular course of action
than physical  compulsion or force of legislative provision.
The word  'force' must	therefore be  constructed to include
not only physical or legal force but also force arising from
the compulsion	of economic  circumstance  which  leaves  no
choice of  alternatives to  a person in want and compels him
to provide  labour or  service even  though the remuneration
received for  it is less than the minimum wage of course, if
a person  provides labour  or  service	to  another  against
receipt of the minimum wage, it would not be possible to say
that the  labour or  service  provided	by  him	 is  'forced
labour' because	 he gets-  what he  is entitled under law to
receive. No inference can reasonably be drawn in such a case
that he	 is forced  to provide	labour or  service  for	 the
simple reason  that he	would be providing labour or service
against receipt of what is lawfully payable to him just like
any  other  person  who	 is  not  under	 the  force  of	 any
compulsion. We are therefore of the view that where a person
provides labour or service to another for remuneration which
is less	 than  the  minimum  wage,  the	 labour	 or  service
provided by  him clearly falls within the scope and ambit of
the words  'forced labour'  under Article 23. Such a person
would be  entitled to  come to	the court for enforcement of
his fundamental	 right under  Article 23 by asking the court
to direct  payment of  the minimum  wage to  him so that the
labour or  service provided  by him  ceases  to	 be  'forced
labour' and  the breach	 of Article 23 is  remedied. It  is
therefore clear	 that  when  the  petitioners  alleged	that
minimum wage  was not  paid to	the workmen  employed by the
contractors,  the   complaint  was   really  in	 effect	 and
substance a  complaint against	violation of the fundamental
right of the workmen under Article 23.",

Somewhat curiously learned counsel for the petitioners attempted to seriously invoke Article 23 in their aid It was sought to be contended that denial of salary amounts to begar and forced labour on the assumption that the petitioners may have worked on the post It was submitted that refusal of

remuneration therefor would straightway be a violation of Article 23. Basic reliance herein was sought to be placed on Suraj Narain v. State of M.P., AIR 1960 Madh Pra 303, People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India, AIR 1982 SC 1473 and in the matter of Prison Reforms Enhancement of Wages of Prisoners, AIR 1983 Ker 261.



  ""forced labour, one pressed to carry burden for individuals or public, under old system when pressed for public service no pay was given."" 

 It would thus appear that invoking the concept of begar in the field of public service and remuneration therefor is something wholly bizzare. Such a contention forgets the long drawn out historical retrospect of the evil

institution of begar in our country which Article 23 sought to prohibit. It needs no great erudition to recall that begar was a relic of a dictatorial practice of feudal times earlier in the country where hordes of weaker subjects were compelled to bondage and forced labour and, therefore, Article 23 sought to prohibit and abolish the same and even envisaged that it should be made an offence punishable in accordance with law. Therefore the analogy of begar in its historical perspective as against a claim to remuneration and salary for the voluntary rendering of public service is so remote as to be bordering on the irrelevant   
 




 Again in Dubar Goala v. Union of India, AIR 1952 Cal 496, Bose, J., had occasion to consider the concept of 'forced labour' and 'begar' under Article 23 and concluded as under :--
  ""Coming now to the question whether the work done by the petitioners can be regarded as begar or forced labour within the meaning of Article 23(1) of the Constitution it appears to me that upon the facts of this case it cannot be said that the petitioners are doing begar or forced labour. As I have pointed out already the very idea that the petitioners had voluntarily agreed to do this extra work by entering into a contract to that effect repeals the idea of theirwork beinga forced labour."" 



 36. Learned counsel's reliance on Suraj Narain v. State of M.P., (AIR 1960 Madh Pra 303) (supra) is hardly well placed Therein it was the admitted position that the petitioner was lawfully, appointed to the job and was lawfully working on his post. The Madhya Bharat Civil Service (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1956, which were applicable to the situation did not even remotely prescribe for the withholding of salary by way of punishment It was consequently held that an order of the stoppage of the petitioner's salary was unwarranted and was ultra vires the said Rules. This reasoning is impeccable and there can possibly be no quarrel with such a proposition and the judgment is thus distinguishable. However, the learned single Judge proceeded

to observe that the reason why the withholding of pay is not one of the punishments retained in the Rules aforesaid is that Article 23 of the Constitution prohibits begar. He then proceeded to hold additionally that the stoppage of salary was not only against the Rules but also offended against the spirit of Article 23 of the Constitution. With respect, the 4-line observation in this context was made as a dictum without citing principle or precedent in its support. It is manifest that the issue was not even raised far from being debated before the Court. On behalf of the respondent, the learned Advocate-General front ally assailed this as an unwarranted extension of an altogether different concept, rooted as it is in the history of the country and the concept of the involuntary and compulsive forced labour even when liberally construed. With respect the solitary observation in this case cannot be easily subscribed to and I would wish to record my dissent therefrom.",

policy of the State Government is neither arbitrary nor

is spent on each Doctor at the post-graduate level by the

Government of West Bengal and hence the requirement of the

penalty of Rs.10 Lakhs for each defaulting year is neither

excessive nor disproportionate. There is no fundamental right

to pursue post-graduate medical education for which reason no

complaint can be made by the Appellants for violation of Article

19(1)(g)    of   the    Constitution.           While     dealing     with    the

submissions of infringement of Article 23(1) of the Constitution,

he submitted that imposition of compulsory service for public

purposes is permitted by Article 23(2) of the Constitution. He

referred to a Report of World Health Organisation (WHO)

released in 2010 which also recommended compulsory service

of health professionals in rural and remote areas. Compulsory

services varying from one to nine years are prevalent in about

70 countries.        Utilizing the services of talented and skilled

Article 23
34. Article 23 reads as follows:

 23. “(1) Traffic in human beings and begar and other
    similar forms of forced labour are prohibited and any
    contravention of this provision shall be an offence
    punishable in accordance with law.
    (2) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from
    imposing compulsory service for public purposes,
    and in imposing such service the State shall not
    make any discrimination on grounds only of religion,
    race, caste or class or any of them.”




35. The submission of Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior

Counsel for the Appellants is that the conditions of the bond per

se amount to ‘forced labour’ and thus are violative of Article 23

(1) of the Constitution.      Mr. Dwivedi expostulated the said

submission by referring to Article 23 (2) which confers power on

the State to impose compulsory service for public purpose.

Reliance was placed upon the Constituent Assembly Debates by

Mr. Dwivedi explaining the scope of compulsory employment for

public purpose under Article 23 (2) of the Constitution of India.

The Appellants who are required to work for a short period on a

decent stipend cannot complain that they are made to perform

‘forced labour’, especially after the Appellants have taken an

informed     decision to   avail   the   benefits   of admission   in

Article 23,"Sanjit Roy vs State Of. Rajasthan on 20 January, 1983",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1150530/?formInput=Article%2023,,"When the  writ petition  reached hearing before us, the
State Government  produced the	Rajsthan Famine Relief Works
Employees   (Exemption	 from	Labour	 Laws)	 Act,	1964
(hereinafter referred  to as  the Exemption Act) and relying
upon this statute, the State Government contended that since
the construction work of Madangang Harmara Road was a famine
relief work,  the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 was not applicable
to employees  engaged on this construction work by reason of
section 3  of this  Act. The  Exemption Act  is a  Rajasthan
statute enacted	 on 7th	 September 1964	 and it is deemed to
have come into force with effect from 1st July 1963. Section
2 clause  (b) of  this Act  defines ""famine relief works"" to
mean ""works  already  started  or  which  may  hereafter  be
started by the State Government to provide relief to persons
affected by  drought and  scarcity conditions""	and  ""Labour
Law"" is	 defined in section 2 clause (c) to mean ""any of the
enactments as  in force	 in Rajasthan relating to Labour and
specified in  the Schedule"".The	 Minimum Wages	Act, 1948 is
one of	the enactments	specified in  the  Schedule  to	 the
Exemption Act.	Then section 3 of the Exemption Act proceeds
to enact  that ""Notwithstanding.....any such law."" Section 4
of the Exemption Act excludes the jurisdiction of courts and
provides that  ""no court shall take cognizance of any matter
in respect  of an employees of famine relief works under any
Labour Law"",  which includes the Minimum Wages Act 1948. Now
if the	Exemption Act  were a valid piece of legislation, it
is obvious  that no workman employed in a famine relief work
would be  entitled to complain that he is paid less than the
minimum wage  because the applicability of the Minimum Wages
Act, 1948 would be

excluded by reason of section 3 of the Exemption Act and the
women workers  engaged in the construction work of Madanganj
Harmara Road  would have to be content with whatever wage is
paid to them even though it be less than the minimum wage of
Rs. 7  per day	and their  only complaint  which would	then
survive would  be that	there is discrimination by reason of
differential payment  of wages	to workmen  doing  the	same
quantity of  work. The	petitioner therefore sought leave to
amend the  writ petition  by including	a challenge  to	 the
constitutional validity	 of the	 Exemption Act	and on	such
leave being  granted, the  petitioner filed  an amended writ
petition in  this Court.  The principal grounds on which the
constitutionality of  the Exemption  Act was challenged were
based on  Articles 14  and 23 of the Constitution. I am, for
reasons which  I shall presently state, of the view that the
challenge under	 Article 23  is  well	founded	 and  it  is
therefore not necessary to investigate the facts relating to
the violation  of Article  14 and  I accordingly  propose to
confine my  judgment only  to a	 consideration of the attack
based	on   Article 23.   If	  the	Exemption   Act	  is
unconstitutional on  the ground that it violates Article 23,
it would  be out  of the  way so  far as  the claim  of	 the
workmen for  the minimum  wage of Rs. 7 per day is concerned
and the	 only question then would be whether the workmen are
entitled to  the minimum  wage of Rs. 7 per day in any event
or any	deduction can  be made from such minimum wage on the
ground that  the workmen  have not turned out work according
to the norm set down by the Public Works Department.



 This Court	 had occasion  to consider  the true meaning
and effect  of Article 23  in	a  judgment  given  on	18th
September 1982	in writ	 petition No.  8143 of	1981-Peoples
Union for  Democratic Rights  and Ors. v. Union of India and
Ors.   (1) The	Court  pointed	out  that  the	constitution
makers, when  they set	out to frame the Constitution, found
that the practice of 'forced labour' constituted an ugly and
shameful feature of our national life which cried for urgent
attention and  with a view to obliterating and wiping out of
existence this	revolting practice  which was  a relic	of a
feudal exploitative  society totally  incompatible with	 new
egalitarian socio-economic  order which	 ""We the  people  of
India"" were  determined to build, they enacted Article 23 in
the Chapter  on Fundamental  Rights. This  Article, said the
Court, is intended to eradicate the pernicious

practice of  'forced labour'  and to  wipe it out altogether
from the  national scene  and it is therefore not limited in
its application against the State but it is also enforceable
against any  other person  indulging in such practice. It is
designed to  protect the  individual not  only	against	 the
state but  also against	 other private	citizens. The  Court
observed that  the expression ""other similar forms of forced
labour"" in Article 23 is of the widest amplitude and on its,
true interpretation  it covers every possible form of forced
labour begar or otherwise and it makes no difference whether
the person  forced to  give his labour or service to another
is remunerated	or not. Even if remuneration is paid, labour
supplied by  a person  would be hit by this Article if it is
forced labour, that is, labour supplied not willingly but as
a result  of force  or compulsion  and the same would be the
position even  if forced labour supplied by a person has its
origin in  a contract  of service. The Court then considered
whether there  would be	 any breach  of Article 23  when  a
person provides	 labour or  service to	the State  or to any
other person  and is  paid less than the minimum wage for it
and observed:



	  ""It  is  obvious  that  ordinarily  no  one  would
     willingly supply  labour or service to another for less
     than the minimum wage, when he knows that under the law
     he is entitled to get minimum for the labour or service
     provided by  him.	It  may	 therefore  be	legitimately
     presumed that  when a person provides labour or service
     to another	 against receipt  of remuneration  which  is
     less than	the minimum  wage, he  is acting  under	 the
     force of  some compulsion	which  drives  him  to	work
     though he	is paid	 less than what he is entitled under
     the law  to  receive.  What  Article 23  prohibits  is
     'forced labour'  that is  labour  or  service  which  a
     person is	forced to  provide and	'force' which  would
     make such	labour or  service 'forced labour' may arise
     in several	 ways. It  may be  physical force  which may
     compel a person to provide labour or service to another
     or it  may be  forced exerted through a legal provision
     such as  a provision  for imprisonment  or fine in case
     the employee  fails to  provide labour or service or it
     may even be compulsion arising from hunger and poverty,
     want and  destitution.  Any  factor  which	 deprives  a
     person of	a choice  of alternatives and compels him to
     adopt one	particular course  of action may properly be
     regarded  as   'force'and	if   labour  or	 service  is
     compelled as a result of such

     'force',it would  be 'forced labour'. Where a person is
     suffering from  hunger or	starvation, when  he has  no
     resources at  all to  fight disease or to feed his wife
     and children  or even  to hide  their  nakedness  where
     utter grinding  poverty has broken his back and reduced
     him to a state of helplessness and despair and where no
     other employment  is available  to alleviate the rigour
     of his  poverty, he  would have no choice but to accept
     any work  that comes  his way, even if the remuneration
     offered to	 him is less than the minimum wage. He would
     be in  no position	 to bargain  with the  employer;  he
     would have	 to accept  what is  offered to	 him. And in
     doing so  he would be acting not as a free agent with a
     choice between alternatives but under the compulsion of
     economic  circumstances   and  the	 labour	 or  service
     provided by him would be clearly 'forced labour'. There
     is no  reason why the word 'forced' should be read in a
     narrow and	 restricted manner so as to be confined only
     to physical  or legal  'force'  particularly  when	 the
     national charter, its fundamental document has promised
     to build  a new  socialist republic where there will be
     socioeconomic justice  for all  and everyone shall have
     the right	to work,  to education and to adequate means
     of livelihood.  The constitution  makers have  given us
     one of  the most  remarkable documents  in history	 for
     ushering  in   a  new   socio-economic  order  and	 the
     Constitution which they have forged for us has a social
     purpose and  an economic  mission and  therefore  every
     word or  phrase in the constitution must be interpreted
     in a  manner which	 would	advance	 the  socio-economic
     objective of  the Constitution.  It is not unoften that
     in a  capitalist society  economic circumstances  exert
     much greater  pressure on	an individual in driving him
     to	 a   particular	 course	  of  action  than  physical
     compulsion or  force of legislative provision. The word
     'force' must therefore be construed to include not only
     physical or legal force but also force arising from the
     compulsion of  economic circumstances  which leaves  no
     choice of	alternatives to a person in want and compels
     him to  provide  labour  or  service  even	 though	 the
     remuneration received  for it  is less than the minimum
     wage. Of course, if a person provides labour or service
     to another	 against receipt  of the  minimum  wage,  it
     would not be possible to say that the labour or service
     provided by him is 'forced

     labour' because  he gets  what he is entitled under law
     to receive.  No inference	can reasonably	be drawn  in
     such a  case that	he is  forced to  provide labour  or
     service  for   the	 simple	 reason	 that  he  would  be
     providing labour  or service against receipt of what is
     lawfully payable  to him just like any other person who
     is not  under the	force  of  any	compulsion.  We	 are
     therefore of  the view  that where	 a  person  provides
     labour or	service to another for remuneration which is
     less than	the minimum  wage,  the	 labour	 or  service
     provided by  him clearly  falls within  the  scope	 and
     ambit of  the words  'forced labour'  under Article 23,
     Such a  person would  be entitled	to come to the court
     for enforcement  of his fundamental right under Article
23 by asking the court to direct payment of the minimum
     wage to  him so  that the labour or service provided by
     him ceases	 to be	'forced labour'	 and the  breach  of
     Article 23 is remedied.""



     If this be the correct position in law, it is difficult
to see	how the constitutional validity of the Exemption Act
in so  far as  it excludes  the applicability of the Minimum
wages Act  1948 to  the workmen	 employed in  famine  relief
works can  be sustained.  Article 23,  as pointed out above,
mandates that  no person  shall be  required or permitted to
provide labour	or service to another on payment of anything
less than  the minimum	wage and  if the  Exemption Act,  by
excluding the  applicability of	 the Minimum Wages Act 1948,
provides that  minimum wage  may not  be paid  to a  workman
employed in  any famine	 relief work,  it would	 be  clearly
violative of  Article 23.  The respondent  however contended
that when the State undertakes famine relief work with

a view	to providing help to the persons affected by drought
and scarcity conditions, it would be difficult for the State
to comply  with the  labour laws,  because if the State were
required to  observe the laws, the potential of the State to
provide employment to the affected persons would be crippled
and the	 State would  not be  able to  render  help  to	 the
maximum number	of affected  persons and  it  was  for	this
reason that  the applicability of the Minimum Wages Act 1948
was excluded  in relation  to  workmen	employed  in  famine
relief work.  This contention,	plausible though it may seem
is in,	my opinion,  unsustainable and	cannot be  accepted.
When the  State undertakes famine relies work it is no doubt
true that  it does  so in order to provide relief to persons
affected by  drought and  scarcity conditions  but none	 the
less it	 is work  which enures	for the benefit of the State
representing  the  society  and	 if  labour  or	 service  is
provided by the affected persons for carrying out such work,
there is  no reason  why the  State should pay anything less
than the  minimum wage to the affected persons. It is not as
if a  dole or  bounty is  given by the State to the affected
persons in  order to  provide relief to them against drought
and scarcity conditions nor is the work to be carried out by
the affected  persons worthless or useless to the society so
that under  the guise  of providing  work what	the State in
effect and  substance seeks  to do is to give dole or bounty
to the	affected persons.  The court  cannot proceed  on the
basis that  the State  would  undertake	 by  way  of  famine
relief, work  which is worthless and without utility for the
society and indeed no democratic State which is administered
by a  sane and	sensible Government  would do  so because it
would be  sheer waste of human labour and resource which can
usefully be  diverted into  fruitful and productive channels
leading to  the welfare	 of the	 community and	creation  of
national asset	or wear.  It is	 difficult to appreciate why
the State  should require  the affected	 persons to  provide
labour or service on work which is of no use to the society,
instead of  simply distributing	 dole or  bounty amongst the
affected persons.  There is no reason which the State should
resort to  such a camouflage. The presumption therefore must
be that	 the work  undertaken by  the State by way of famine
relief is  useful to  the society and productive in terms of
creation of  some asset	 or wealth and when the State exacts
labour or  service from the affected persons for carring out
such work,  for example,  a bridge  or	a  road,  which	 has
utilised for  the society  and which is going to augment the
wealth of  the State,  there can be no justification for the
State not  to pay  minimum wage to the affected persons. The
State cannot be permitted to take advantage of the

helpless condition  of	the  affected  persons	and  extract
labour or  service from	 them on  payment of  less than	 the
minimum wage. No work of utility and value can be allowed to
be constructed	on the	blood and  sweat of  persons who are
reduced to a state of helplessness on account of drought and
scarcity conditions.  The State	 cannot under  the guise  of
helping these  affected persons	 extract work of utility and
value from  them  without  paying  them	 the  minimum  wage.
Whenever any  labour or	 service is  taken by the State from
any person,  whether he	 be affected by drought and scarcity
conditions or not, the State must pay, at the least, minimum
wage to	 such person  on pain of violation of Article 23 and
the Exemption Act in so far as it excludes the applicability
of the	Minimum Wages Act 1948 to workmen employed on famine
relief work  and permits  payment of  less than	 the minimum
wage to	 such  workmen,	 must  be  held	 to  be	 invalid  as
offending the  provisions of  Article 23.  The Exemption Act
cannot in the circumstances be relied upon by the respondent
as exempting  it from  the liability  to pay minimum wage to
the workmen  engaged in	 the construction  work of Madanganj
Harmara Road.",

employed on  the  construction	of  roads  and	in  building

workers were  not paid	this  minimum  wage  and  they	were
exploited by  the contractors and the jamadars. The Union of

jamadars.      It was  also pointed  out by  the petitioners
that there  was violation  of Article 24 of the Constitution
and of	the provisions	of the	Employment of  Children Act,
1938 in	 as much  as children below the age of 14 years were
employed by  the contractors in the construction work of the
various projects.  The petitioners also alleged violation of
the  provisions	 of  the  Contract  Labour  (Regulation	 and
Abolition) Act	1970 and  pointed out  various	breaches  of
those  provisions  by  the  contractors	 which	resulted  in
deprivation and	 exploitation of the workers employed in the
construction work  of most  of the projects. It was also the
case of	 the petitioners that the workers were denied proper
living conditions  and medical and other facilities to which
they were  entitled under  the provisions  of  the  Contract
Labour (Regulation  and Abolition) Act 1970. The petitioners
also complained	 that the  contractors were not implementing
the  provisions	  of  the   Inter  State   Migrant   Workmen
(Regulation of	Employment and	Conditions of  Service)	 Act
1979 though  that Act  was brought  in force  in  the  Union
Territory of  Delhi as	far back  as 2nd  October 1980.	 The
report of  the team  of three social scientists on which the
writ  petition	was  based  set	 out  various  instances  of
violations of the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948,
the  Equal   Remuneration  Act	 1976,	Article 24  of	 the
Constitution, The  Employment of  Children Act 1970, and the
Inter State  Migrant Workmen  (Regulation of  Employment and
Conditions of Service) Act 1979.

section (3) of section 3 of that Act. Now unfortunately this
contention urged  on  behalf  of  the  respondents  is	well
founded, because construction industry does not find a place
in the	Schedule to  the Employment of Children Act 1938 and
the prohibition enacted in section 3 sub-section (3) of that
Act against  the employment of a child who has not completed
his  fourteenth	  year	cannot	 apply	to   employment	  in
construction industry. This is a sad and deplorable omission
which, we  think, must	be immediately	set right  by  every
State Government  by amending  the Schedule so as to include
construction  industry	in  it	in  exercise  of  the  power
conferred under	 section 3A  of the  Employment of  Children
Act, 1938.  We hope  and trust	that every  State Government
will take  the necessary  steps in  this behalf	 without any
undue  delay,	because	 construction	work  is  clearly  a
hazardous occupation and it is absolutely essential that the
employment of  children under  the age	of 14  years must be
prohibited in every type of construction work. That would be
in  consonance	 with  Convention  No.	59  adopted  by	 the
International Labour Organisation and ratified by India. But
apart altogether  from the requirement of Convention No. 59,
we have	 Article 24  of the Constitution which provides that
no child  below the  age of  14 shall be employed to work in
any factory  or mine  or  engaged  in  any  other  hazardous
employment. This is a constitutional prohibition which, even
if not	followed up by appropriate legislation, must operate
proprio vigore	and  construction  work	 being	plainly	 and
indubitably a  hazardous employment,  it is  clear  that  by
reason of  this constitutional	prohibition, no	 child below
the age	 of 14	years  can  be	allowed	 to  be	 engaged  in
construction work.  There can  therefore be  no	 doubt	that
notwithstanding the absence of specification of construction
industry in  the Schedule  to the Employment of Children Act
1938, no  child below the age of 14 years can be employed in
construction work and the Union of India as also every State
Government must	 ensure that  this constitutional mandate is
not violated  in any  part of  the country. Here, of course,
the plea of the Union of India, the Delhi Administration and
the Delhi  Development Authority was that no child below the
age of 14 years was at any time employed in the construction
work of these projects and in any event no complaint in that
behalf was  received by	 any of	 these Authorities and hence
there was  no violation	 of the	 constitutional	 prohibition
enacted in  Article 24. So far as the complaint in regard to
non-observance of  the provisions of the Inter State Migrant
Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service)
Act 1979  was concerned,  the defence of the Union of India,
the Delhi Administration and the Delhi Development Authority
that though this Act had come into force in the

Union Territory	 of Delhi with effect from 2nd October 1980,
the power to enforce the provisions of the Act was delegated
to the Administrator of the Union Territory of Delhi only on
14th July 1981 and thereafter also the provisions of the Act
could not  been enforced  because the Rules to be made under
the Act	 had not  been finalised  until 4th June 1982. It is
difficult to understand as to why in the case of beneficient
legislation like the Inter State Migrant Workmen (Regulation
of Employment  and Conditions of Service) Act 1979 it should
have taken  more than  18 months for the Government of India
to delegate  the power	to enforce the provisions of the Act
to the	Administrator of  the Union  Territory of  Delhi and
another almost 12 months to make the Rules under the Act. It
was well known that a large number of migrant workmen coming
from different States were employed in the construction work
of various  Asiad projects and if the provisions of a social
welfare legislation  like the  Inter State  Migrant  Workmen
(Regulation of	Employment and	Conditions of  Service)	 Act
1979 were  applied and	the benefit  of such provisions made
available to  these migrant  workmen, it  would have  gone a
long way  towards ameliorating	their conditions of work and
ensuring them  a decent	 living with basic human dignity. We
very much  wished that	the provisions	of this Act had been
made applicable	 earlier to  the migrant workmen employed in
the construction  work of  these  projects  though  we	must
confess that  we do  not see  why  the	enforcement  of	 the
provisions of  the Act	should have  been held	up until the
making of  the Rules.  It is  no doubt	true that  there are
certain provisions  in the  Act	 which	cannot	be  enforced
unless there  are rules made under the Act but equally there
are other  provisions which  do not need any prescription by
the Rules  for their enforcement and these latter provisions
could certainly	 have been  enforced by the Administrator of
the Union  Territory of	 Delhi in  so far as migrant workmen
employed in  these projects  were concerned. There can be no
doubt that  in any  event from	and after 4th June, 1982 the
provisions  of	this  beneficient  legislation	have  become
enforceable  and   the	migrant	  workmen  employed  in	 the
construction work  of these  projects are  entitled  to	 the
rights	and   benefits	conferred   upon  them	under  those
provisions. We	need not point out that so far as the rights
and  benefits  conferred  upon	migrant	 workmen  under	 the
provisions of section 13 to 16 of the Act are concerned, the
responsibility for  ensuring such  rights and benefits rests
not only  on the contractors but also on the Union of India,
the Delhi  Administration or the Delhi Development Authority
who is

the principal  employer in relation to the construction work
entrusted by  it to the contractors. We must confess that we
have serious  doubts whether  the provisions of this Act are
being  implemented   in	 relation  to  the  migrant  workmen
employed in  the construction  work of these projects and we
have therefore	by our	Order dated  11th May 1982 appointed
three  Ombudsmen   for	the   purpose  of   making  periodic
inspection and	reporting to  us whether  the provisions  of
this Act are being implemented at least from 4th June 1982.



 That takes	 us to	a consideration of the other limb of
the  second  preliminary  objection.  The  argument  of	 the
respondents under  this head  of preliminary  objection	 was
that a	writ petition  under Article 32 cannot be maintained
unless it complains of a breach of some fundamental right or
the other  and since  what were	 alleged in the present writ
petition were  merely violations  of the labour laws enacted
for the	 benefit of  the workmen  and not  breaches  of	 any
fundamental  rights,  the  present  writ  petition  was	 not
maintainable and  was liable to be dismissed. Now it is true
that the  present writ	petition cannot be maintained by the
petitioners  unless  they  can	show  some  violation  of  a
fundamental right,  for it  is only  for  enforcement  of  a
fundamental right  that a writ petition can be maintained in
this Court  under Article  32. So  far	we  agree  with	 the
contention of  the respondents but there our agreement ends.
We cannot  accept the  plea  of	 the  respondents  that	 the
present writ  petition does  not complain of any breach of a
fundamental right.  The complaint of violation of Article 24
based on  the averment	that children  below the  age of  14
years are  employed in	the construction  work of  the Asiad
projects  is   clearly	a   complaint  of   violation  of  a
fundamental right.  So also when the petitioners allege non-
observance of  the provisions  of the Equal Remuneration Act
1946, it is in effect and substance a complaint of breach of
the principle  of  equality  before  the  law  enshrined  in
Article 14  and it  can	 hardly	 be  disputed  that  such  a
complaint can legitimately form the subject matter of a writ
petition under	Article 32.  Then there	 is the complaint of
non-observance of  the provisions  of  the  Contract  Labour
(Regulation &  Abolition)  Act	1970  and  the	Inter  State
Migrant Workmen	 (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of
Service) Act  1979  and	 this  is  also	 in  our  opinion  a
complaint relating  to violation of Article 21. This Article
has

acquired a new dimension as a result of the decision of this
Court in  Maneka Gandhi	 v. Union  of India  (1) and  it has
received  its	most  expansive	 interpretation	 in  Francis
Coralie Mullin	v. The	Administrator,	Union  Territory  of
Delhi &	 Ors,(2) where	it has	been held by this Court that
the right  to life  guaranteed under  this  Article  is	 not
confined merely	 to physical  existence or to the use of any
faculty or  limb through  which life  is enjoyed or the soul
communicates with  outside world but it also includes within
its scope  and ambit  the right	 to live  with	basic  human
dignity and  the  State	 cannot	 deprive  any  one  of	this
precious and  invaluable right because no procedure by which
such deprivation  may be  effected can	ever be	 regarded as
reasonable, fair  and just.  Now  the  rights  and  benefits
conferred on  the workmen employed by a contractor under the
provisions of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition)
Act 1970  and the Inter State Migrant Workmen (Regulation of
Employment and	Conditions of Service) Act, 1979 are clearly
intended to ensure basic human dignity to the workmen and if
the workmen are deprived of any of these rights and benefits
to which they are entitled under the provisions of these two
pieces of  social welfare legislation, that would clearly be
a violation  of Article	 21 by the Union of India, the Delhi
Administration and the Delhi Development Authority which, as
principal employers,  are made	statutorily responsible	 for
securing such  rights and  benefits  to	 the  workmen.	That
leaves for  consideration the  complaint in  regard to	non-
payment of  minimum wage  to the  workmen under	 the Minimum
Wages Act  1948. We  are of  the view that this complaint is
also one  relating to  breach of a fundamental right and for
reasons	 which	 we  shall   presently	state,	 it  is	 the
fundamental right  enshrined in Article 23 which is violated
by non-payment of minimum wage to the workmen.



Now many  of the  fundamental rights  enacted  in  Part	 III
operate as  limitations on the power of the State and impose
negative  obligations  on  the	State  not  to	encroach  on
individual liberty and they are enforceable only against the
State. But there are certain fundamental rights conferred by
the Constitution  which are  enforceable against  the  whole
world and they are to be found inter alia in Articles 17, 23
and 24.	 We have  already discussed the true scope and ambit
of Article 24 in  an earlier  portion of  this judgment and
hence we  do not  propose to  say anything more about it. So
also we	 need not expatiate on the proper meaning and effect
of the	fundamental right  enshrined in	 Article 17 since we
are not	 concerned with	 that Article  in the  present	writ
petition. It  is Article  23 with which we are concerned and
that Article  is clearly  designed to protect the individual
not only  against the  State but  also against other private
citizens. Article  23 is  not  limited	in  its	 application
against the  State but it prohibits ""traffic in human beings
and  begar   and  other	 similar  forms	 of  forced  labour""",

circumstances of the case, the disallowance under section 40(a)(i) of the
Act is correct in law. His arguments are summarized as under:
     (a) that provisions of article 9(1) of DTAA apply to the facts of this
        case, which is one of the exceptions mentioned in article 24(3)
        of the DTAA, thus, the assessee cannot invoke article 24(3) of
        the DTAA between Indian & Japan.
     (b) that in the case of Herbalife International India private limited
        (supra) the Hon'ble High Court at para-34 has recorded that it is
        not the case of the Revenue that article 9(1) or article 11(7)
        applies in that case and hence the case is distinguishable


                                                     & 5483/Del/2014







 (h) that the order of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in Herbalife
        (supra) relied upon by the assessee does not deal with the
        provision of section 40(a)(i) as amended by Finance Act (No.2)
        2004, w.e.f., 01/04/2005.

10.   In rejoinder, the Ld. counsel of the assessee submitted that all the
contention raised by the Ld. CIT(DR) had already been considered by
the coordinate bench in the assessee's own case for assessment year
2009-10. The learned counsel also submitted that the arguments taken
up by the Revenue on the applicability of article 9 of the DTAA and
hence the exclusion of article 24(3) has no merits since the TPO are
consistently found that the transaction between the assessee and all the
non-resident companies were at arm's length. He submitted that a plain
reading of article 9 of the DTAA reveals that what is required under the
said article is that the transaction between the associated enterprises
should be conducted on arm's length basis and uninfluenced by the
close relationship. He submitted that said test has been met in the
present case when the TPO has found all the transaction between the
assessee and its AEs on arm's length basis. Thus, he submitted that the
effort of the Revenue to distinguish the jurisdictional High Court in the
case of Herbalife (supra), was without any merit.



14. This leaves us with the issue of applicability of the provisions of
S.195 r.w.s. 40(a)(i) to Honda Motor Company Ltd.

15. The issue whether Honda Motor Company Ltd. has a PE in India
or not should be preferably adjudicated by the AO in the assessment
of that company. It is not advisable to determine this issue in
collateral proceedings, as is in the case of the assessee. Thus, we
adjudicate the issue by considering the arguments of the assessee
without prejudice, invoking the non-discrimination clause in terms
of Article 24(3) of the DTAA, between India and Japan. The AO in
this case has denied the benefit of the non-discrimination clause to
the assessee by holding that the provisions of the Income-tax
Act are different from the provisions of the DTAA and hence no
benefit could be given to the assessee. When the matter came up
before the ld.CIT(A), he held that the term used in Article
24(3) related only to royalties, fee for technical services, interest and
the term 'other disbursements' necessarily related to payments in
the same generic and thus the payments for purchases are not
covered by Article 24(3) and hence the benefit of DTAA cannot be
given.



   These findings are binding on us. Thus, we have to uphold the
   arguments of the ld. counsel for the assessee and reverse the
   findings of the AO as confirmed by the ld.CIT(A).

18. Coming to the argument of the ld. DR that the conditions stated
in Article 24(3) are not satisfied, as provisions of Article 9(1) applies,
as the transactions are between AEs and the profits which would,
but for those conditions would have accrued to one of the
enterprises, but by reason of those conditions have not so accrued,
we find that the Transfer Pricing Officer in all these cases has come
to the conclusion that the transactions between the Associated
Enterprises are at arm's length price. The ld. DR made strenuous
and elaborate submissions bringing out certain issues raised by the
AO, to persuade us that TPO was wrong in coming to the conclusion
that the transactions between the AEs and the assessee are at
arm's length. We find that the TPO has passed the order after the
surveys were conducted on the assessee. If the AO had certain
additional material facts, he could have brought it to the notice of the
TPO and asked for a fresh report. In our view, this argument of the
Ld. D.R. is erroneous, as the revenue wants to take a stand that the
transactions between the assessee and its AE are not at arm's
length for the limited purpose of denying the benefit of the non-
discrimination article in the DTAA to the assessee and not for
making any additions under the transfer pricing provisions. Year
after year, the transfer pricing officer has given a finding that the
transactions between the assessee and the AE are at arm's length.
The ld. DR, without specifically pointing out as to what is the
difference between the arm's length price and the price at which the
transactions have taken place between the assessee and the AE
and without quantifying the excess/shortage in the price, seeks to
invoke Article 9(1). In our view, such an argument is devoid of merit
and hence we dismiss the same.",
Article 24,"Deputy Commissioner Of Income Tax ... vs M/S Ibm India Pvt Ltd , Bangalore on 16 November, 2018",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/166907997/?formInput=Article%2024,,"12.   In the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal in IBM India Pvt. Ltd.
(supra), the admitted position is that there is no specific clause in DTAA
regarding income in the nature of FTS. The assessee contended that in
the absence of an 'FTS' clause in the DTAA, Article 7 (business profits)
thereof would be applicable since IBM-Philippines is providing services in
the course of its business and since it does not have a PE in India,
payments made to IBM-Philippines are not chargeable to tax in India.
Alternatively it was contended       that if Article 7 of the DTAA is not
applicable, the payments would be covered by Article 23 (1) of the DTAA
which deals with 'Other Income' which lays down the rule that it is only the
State of residence of the recipient (Philippines) that would have right to tax
'other income' therefore payments to IBM- Philippines a tax resident of

Philippines, would be taxable in Philippines and not in India. Per contra,
Revenue contended that in the absence of 'FTS' clause in the DTAA, as
per Article 24(1) thereof, the taxability of the said payments would be
governed by the domestic laws i.e. Section 9(1)(vii) of the Act and
consequently these payments are chargeable to tax in India and liable for
TDS u/s.195 of the Act.



13.    The Tribunal after referring to Article 23 and 24 of the DTAA
observed that the purpose of Article 24 was elimination of Double Taxation.
The Tribunal referred to Article 24(1) of the DTAA which provided that the
laws in force in either of the Contracting States shall continue to govern the
taxation of income in the respective Contracting States except where
provisions to the contrary are made in this Convention.             The tribunal
observed that at first sight, it may appear that Articles 23 and 24(1) of the
DTAA are in conflict with each other and that Article 23 is an omnibus
clause covering all items of income not dealt with in Articles 6 to 22 but it
was not so because Article 24(1) specifically refers only to income which
are not covered under any of the clauses in the DTAA and therefore Article
24 would be rendered redundant if Article 23(1) were to be construed as
covering all other incomes which are not specifically dealt with any of the
clauses of the DTAA.        The Tribunal observed that if one were to
interpret Article 24(1) as conferring right to tax 'FTS' in accordance with the
domestic law of a contracting state, which is the contention of revenue in
the case on hand, then Article 23 would become redundant since it ceases
to be a residuary / omnibus clause covering items of income, wherever
arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of the Treaty. The tribunal
held that provisions of law or treat need to be interpreted in such a way as
to avoid conflict between the various provisions and referred to the decision
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT Vs. Hindustan Bulk Carriers
                                                 IT(IT)A Nos.1288, 1291, 1294, 1297,
                                                      1300, 1303 & 1306/Bang/2017




(2003) 259 ITR 449. The Tribunal referred to decision of Hon'ble Bombay
ITAT in the case of BNB Paribas SA V DCIT (2013) Tax Corp (AT) 32700,
which dealt with identical clause in DTAA between India-UAE which is
similar to Article 24(1) of DTAA, wherein the Mumbai ITAT held that the
purpose of Article 25(1) of the India-UAE DTAA which is similar to Article
24(1) of the India-Philippines Treaty was to (i) eliminate double taxation
and it is for this purpose, it has been provided that the 'laws in force' in
either of the Contracting States shall continue to govern the taxation of the
income unless express provision to the contrary are made in this
Agreement (ii)provides for deductions or credit of the taxes paid in either of
the states based on either exemption method or providing for credit for
taxes paid in the other country and that Article 25 by itself does not provide
any rules on the mechanism for computing relief. It is only for such
purposes the domestic laws may have to be referred and it cannot be
extended to tax business income falling under Article 7 as per domestic
law.   The Tribunal referring to the aforesaid decision held that Article
24(1) of the India- Philippines DTAA, which is similar to Article 25(1) of the
India-UAE Treaty, does not confer a right to invoke the provisions of
domestic laws for classification or taxability of income which is governed
by Article 6 to 23 of the India-Philippines Treaty and that Article
24(1) operates in the field of computation of doubly taxed income and tax
thereon in accordance with the domestic laws of each contracting state and
is not part of Articles 6 to 23 which deal with the classification of income
into different heads.    Para 2 of CBDT Circular NO.333 dt.2.4.1982
exemplifies what is stated in Article 24 of the India-Philippines DTAA;
providing that the Mode of Computation of income as provided in the DTAA
should be followed and where there is no specific provision in the treaty,
the Income Tax Act will govern the same. Both Article 24 of the India-



                                                 IT(IT)A Nos.1288, 1291, 1294, 1297,
                                                      1300, 1303 & 1306/Bang/2017




Philippine DTAA and CBDT Circular NO.332 dt.2.4.1982 have no role to
play in classification of income and allocation of right to tax such income to
one or both of the contracting states as the same are to be dealt with in
accordance with Article 6 to 23 of the DTAA. Even though the India-
Philippines DTAA does not have an Article dealing with 'FTS', its taxation
would be governed by Articles 7 or Article 23 as the case may be,
depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. If Article 24(1) of
the DTAA is interpreted as dealing with taxation of items of income not
dealt within the foregoing Articles 6 to 23 of the India-Philippines DTAA, as
per domestic laws, it would render Article 23 thereof redundant.              The
Tribunal ultimately held that there is no merit in the contention put forth by
revenue that in the absence of 'FTS' Article under the India-Philippines
Treaty, payments made to IBM-Philippines are taxable in India as
per Article 24(1). Consequently, the findings of the authorities below that
the payments made to IBM Philippines are taxable under Section
9(1)(vii) of the Act on the basis of Article 24(1) of the India-Philippines
DTAA, was held to be incorrect and unsustainable.",
Article 24,"Maersk Tankers Singapore P. Ltd., ... vs The Acit, Inter. Taxa., Rajkot, ... on 30 November, 2022",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/17334354/?formInput=Article%2024,,"13.      The AO has also mentioned at page 30 of the draft assessment order that
the freight income has been remitted to Denmark and not to Singapore and
therefore, it needed to be ascertained whether the freight income is subject to tax
in Singapore by reference to the amount which is actually remitted or by reference
to full amount of freight income. It is found that provisions of Article 24 actually
override the provisions of Article 8 as they limit the relief in case of double non-
taxation of any income. Actually, Article 24 postulates two conditions-namely,
firstly, there should be actual remittance of the impugned amount and secondly,
this amount should be subjected to tax in Singapore also. Singapore follows a
territorial system of taxation where actual amount received is only taxed. The
mischief of Article 24 actually enters when either the amount is not received in
Singapore and if received, is not taxed there (whereas it is taxable at full rates in
India). Given these facts, it is wondered as to why then Article 24 is not being
considered to be invokable, as, apparently, both the conditions are fulfilled and
the touchstone of common sense is also met.

resident of Singapore. Even the factual finding recorded by the Ld.DRP was that
the assessee is a tax resident and does not have a PE in India. Undisputedly, the
activities carried out by the assessee in India are covered under Article 8 of India
Singapore DTAA. As per Article 8 of India Singapore DTAA, the profits derived by
an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in
international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. Therefore, by virtue of
Article 8 of India Singapore DTAA, the international shipping income of a resident
of a Contracting State is taxable only in that State i.e., the shipping income of a
Singaporean resident by the operations of ships in international waters is taxable
only in Singapore on accrual basis. Similarly, Article 24 of India Singapore DTAA
limits the relief on the basis of income from sources in a Contracting State is
exempt from tax or taxed at a reduced rate in that Contracting State and under the
laws in force in the other Contracting State, the said income is subject to tax by
reference to the amount thereof which is remitted to or received in that other
Contracting State and not by reference to the full amount thereof, then the
exemption or reduction of tax to be allowed under this agreement in the first-
mentioned Contracting State shall apply to so much of the income as is remitted to
or received in that other Contracting State. From the combined reading of Articles 8
and 24 of India -Singapore DTAA, it is very clear that article 8 provides exclusive
right of taxation to country of residence, i.e. Singapore on accrual basis. Similarly,
article 24 limits the exemption, in case income is exempt or taxed at reduced rate in
source country, i.e. in India and further such income is taxable in country of
residence on receipt basis. The AO, referring to Article 24 of the tax treaty, was of
the opinion that although global shipping income of a Singapore tax resident is
taxable only at resident State, but by virtue of Article 24 exemption would apply
only to the extent of the amount repatriated / remitted to Singapore. In our view,
the above conclusion of the AO is under the misconception of the provisions of India
Singapore tax treaty, because as per Article 8 of India Singapore tax treaty, it was
clearly specified that only the resident country has the right of taxation of freight
income earned from operation of ships in international traffic. As may be seen from
the provisions of Article 8(1), we are of the considered view that it is not an
exemption provision but an enabling provision which provides an exclusive right of
taxation of income to the residence country. Further, by entering in to treaty with
Singapore, India has given up its right to taxshipping income of a non-resident in
India. Therefore, any income of a non-resident shipping company which is a tax
resident of Singapore is liable to tax only in Singapore but not in India.



15. Having said so, let us examine the applicability of Article 24 of India Singapore
DTAA. Article 24 of India Singapore DTAA contemplates twin conditions for its
applicability. The first condition is that income sourced in a Contracting State and
such income should be exempt or taxed at a reduced rate by virtue of any article
under the India Singapore DTAA. As we noted earlier Article 8 of India Singapore
DTAA does not provide for exemption or reduced rate of taxation of such income. It
is crucial to note that Article 8 of India Singapore DTAA contemplates the taxation
rights of a particular income in particular State. As per said article, the country of
residence is having exclusive right over taxation of shipping income and that being
the case, the assessee being resident of Singapore vest with right to tax such
income under the Singapore Income Tax laws. Accordingly, the shipping income
earned in India is neither exempt nor taxed at reduced rate as per Article 8 of
DTAA which is a condition precedent for applicability of Article 24. This fact has
been clarified by the IRAS vide its letter dated 17.09.2018, where it was
specifically sated that provisions of Article 24 of India Singapore DTAA would not
be applicable to the shipping income. The second condition that is required to be
looked in to before applying Article 24 of DTAA is income of the non-resident should
be taxable on ""receipt"" basis in Singapore. As we have already noted in earlier
para of this order, under Article 8 of India Singapore DTAA, global shipping income
of a tax resident of Singapore is only taxable in the country of residence. Once the
income is taxable in the country of residence on ""accrual"" basis, the second
condition prescribed under Article 24 of India Singapore DTAA is not satisfied. This
fact is further strengthened by the letter of the Inland Revenue Authority Singapore
(IRAS) letter 17.09.2018, where it was clarified that the income of a Singaporean
company from the operation of ships in international traffic is taxable in Singapore
on ""accrual"" basis. Thus, both the conditions ofArticle 24 is not satisfied in the
present case. We, therefore are of the considered view that the AO was erred in
invoking Article 24 of India Singapore DTAA to tax the income earned by the
assessee from shipping operations in India.



16. The interplay between Article 8 and 24 of India Singapore DTAA has been
considered by various Tribunals and Courts. As per the settled position of law, the
                                        - 26 -
                                                                     ITA No.17/Rjt/2022
 Maersk Tankers Singapore Pte. Ltd. vs. The ACIT (Int. Taxation)
                                                                   Asst.Year - 2017-18

Article 24 Limitation of Benefit is not applicable once shipping income of a non-
resident is taxable on ""accrual"" basis in the country of residence. This principle is
well settled by the decision of the Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the case of M.T.
Maersk Mikage vs. DIT(International Taxation) supra, where the Hon'ble court
clearly held that where income earned by Singapore based shipping company
through shipping business carried out at Indian Ports, was not taxable at
Singapore on basis of remittance but on basis of accrual, clause (1) of Article 24 of
Indo-Singapore DTAA would not apply to deny benefit of Article 8 of Indo-
Singapore DTAA to said company. The Hon'ble High Court while considering the
issue has analyzed the provisions of Article 8 vis-à-vis Article 24 of DTAA and after
considering relevant facts, the court held that in case certain income is taxed by a
Contracting State not on the basis of accrual but on the basis of remittance,
applicability of Article 8 would be ousted to the extent such income is not remitted.
The court further held that this clause does not provide that in every case of non-
remittance of income to the Contracting State, Article 8 would not apply irrespective
of tax treatment such income is given. The Hon'ble court while arriving at the above
conclusion has taken support from the letter issued by Singapore Revenue
Authority clarifying the taxation position of global shipping income of tax resident
of Singapore and held that when shipping income of a tax resident of Singapore
was taxable at Singapore on the basis of accrual, the very basis of applying Article
24 would not survive. This issue was further considered by the Mumbai Bench of
ITAT in the case of APL Co. Pte Ltd vs. ADIT, 78 taxmann.com 240, where it was
held that in order to invoke provisions of Article 24, two conditions need to be
fulfilled. Firstly, income earned from source State (India) is exempt from tax or is
taxed at a reduced rate in source State (India) as per DTAA; and secondly as per
the laws in force of resident state (Singapore), such income is subject to tax by
reference to amount thereof which is remitted to or received in resident State and
not by reference to full amount thereof. The Tribunal further noted that the key
phrases which need to be borne in mind while understanding Article 24 is ""under
the laws in force in other contracting state"" (Singapore). Here, in this case, the
income of assessee company from shipping operations is not taxable on remittance
basis under the laws of Singapore, albeit is liable to be taxed in principle on
accrual basis by virtue of the fact that this income under the income tax laws of
Singapore is regarded as ""accruing in or derived from Singapore"". A similar view
has been expressed by the Hyderabad Bench of the Tribunal in the case of Far
Shipping (Singapore) Pte Ltd vs. ITO, 84 taxmann.com 297. Further, the Mumbai
Bench of the Tribunal in the case of DCIT vs. D.B. International (Asia) Ltd., 96
taxmann.com 75 has dealt with the interplay between the Article 13 and 24 and
after considering relevant clauses categorically held that income derived by a
resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that state in view of the
clear and unambiguous terms of DTAA. Therefore, we are of the considered view
that in terms of Article 8 of India Singapore DTAA, global income of a tax resident
of Singapore from shipping operations, even though which is earned outside
Singapore is taxable only in Singapore on accrual basis and consequently Article
24 of India Singapore DTAA cannot be invoked to deny the benefit of exemption
merely for the simple reason that the said income was not taxed in Singapore by
virtue of separate exemptions provided under Singapore Income Tax Act.",
Article 24,"Mitsubishi Corporation India Pvt. ... vs Dcit, Circle- 16(2), New Delhi on 22 September, 2017",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/122427784/?formInput=Article%2024,,"16. In order to appreciate the above rival contentions, it would
be apposite to consider the mandate of Article 24, the relevant
part of which, is as under:-
ARTICLE 24 - 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall be
subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any
requirement connected therewith which is other or more
burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to
which nationals of that other Contracting State in the same
                                15                 ITA No5184/Del/2017


circumstances are or may be subjected. This provision shall,
notwithstanding the provisions of article 1, also apply to persons
who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States.



                               16                   ITA No5184/Del/2017




18.     The case of the ld. AR is that the assessee is entitled to the
benefit of Article 24 in terms of para 3. A perusal of this para
transpires that except where the provisions of Article 9 etc. apply,
interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an Indian
enterprise to a Japanese enterprise, shall, be deductible in
determining the taxable profits of the Indian enterprise under the
same conditions as if they had been paid to an Indian resident.
Simply stated, para 3 of Article 24 provides that any payment
made by an Indian enterprise to a Japanese enterprise shall, for
the purposes of determining the taxable profit of an Indian
enterprise, be taken up under the same conditions as if the
payment had been made to an Indian resident and not to a non-
resident. In simple words, for the purpose of computing the
taxable profit of an Indian enterprise, the provisions of the Act
shall apply on a transaction with a Japanese enterprise as if it is a
transaction with an Indian enterprise. If the transaction with a
Japanese enterprise entails some adverse consequences in
comparison with if such transaction had been made with an
Indian enterprise, then such adverse consequences will be
remedied under this clause by presuming, for computing the total
income of an Indian enterprise, as if it was a transaction with an
Indian enterprise and not a Japanese enterprise. Thus, Article 24
provides in unequivocal terms that for the purposes of
determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, any
disbursements made to a Japanese enterprise shall be deductible
in the same manner as if it had been made to an Indian resident.
When we examine the TDS provisions, it is noticed that no
provision under the Chapter XVII of the Act stipulates for
deduction of tax at source from payment made for the purchases
made from an Indian resident. This position when contrasted
with purchases made from a non-resident, imposes liability on the
purchaser for deducting tax at source under section 195, subject
to the fulfilment of other conditions. When we compare an Indian
enterprise purchasing goods from an Indian party vis-a-vis from a
Japanese party, there is possibility of an obvious discrimination
in terms of disallowance of purchase consideration under section
40(a)(i) in so far as the purchases from a Japanese enterprise are
concerned. It is this discrimination which is sought to be
remedied by para 3 of Article 24. The effect of this Article is that
in determining the taxable profits of an Indian enterprise, the
provisions of the Act, including disallowance u/s 40(a)(i), shall
apply as if the purchases made from a Japanese enterprise are
made from an Indian enterprise. Once purchases are construed to
have been made by an Indian enterprise from another Indian
enterprise, not requiring any deduction of tax at source from the
                              17                   ITA No5184/Del/2017


purchase consideration and consequently ousting the application
of section 40(a)(i), the non-discrimination clause shall operate to
stop the making of disallowance in case of purchases actually
made from a Japanese enterprise, which would have otherwise
attracted the disallowance. Thus, it is evident that para 3 of
Article 24, without considering the effect of Article 9 and other
Articles referred to in the beginning of this para, rules out the
making of disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.



19.     Now let us examine Article 9 of the DTAA and its setting
in Article 24(3), which in the opinion of the ld. DR, comes to the
rescue of the Revenue in making inoperative the otherwise
applicability of para 3 of Article 24. The opening part of para 3
provides that `Except where the provisions of article 9 .... apply'.
Then it talks about the application of non-discrimination as
discussed above. This shows that the provisions of Article 24(3)
shall be restricted to the extent of applicability of Article 9. In
other words, whatever has been provided in Article 9 shall remain
intact and will have superseding effect over the mandate of
Article 24(3). The contention of the ld. DR that once Article 9
applies, then the application of Article 24(3) is thrown out, is not
wholly correct. The writ of Article 9 does not stop the
application of Article 24(3) in entirety. The overriding effect of
Article 9 over para 3 of Article 24 is limited to its content alone.
In other words, the mandate of Article 24 applies save and except
as provided in Article 9 etc. It does not render Article 24(3)
redundant in totality. A conjoint reading of these two Articles
brings out that if there is some discrimination in computing the
taxable income as regards the substance of Article 9, then such
discrimination will continue as such. But, in so far as rest of the
discriminations covered under para 3 of Article 24 are concerned,
those will be removed to the extent as provided.



20.     Now let us decipher the instruction of the relevant part of
Article 9 of the DTAA as extracted above. Para 1 of this Article
can be viewed in two parts, viz., clause (a) or clause (b) as one
part and the portion starting with `and' as the second part. Such
first part sets out the basic condition for the applicability of the
second part. The first part provides for the one enterprise directly
or indirectly controlling or contributing to the capital of the other
or the existence of common persons managing or contributing to
the capital of both the enterprises. The existence of the conditions
set out in the first part in the case of the assessee has not been
disputed by the ld. AR. The second part of para 1 of Article 9
provides that when the stipulations of the first part of para 1 of
Article 9 are satisfied AND the conditions between the two
                              18                  ITA No5184/Del/2017


enterprises in their commercial or financial relations differ from
those which would have been between two independent
enterprises, then, any profit which has not accrued to one of the
enterprises due to such conditions, may be included in the profits
of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. The effect of the second
part is that the transactions between the two enterprises should be
viewed at arm's length notwithstanding their commercial or
financial relations. And if the profit accruing to an enterprise has
been understated due to such commercial or financial relations,
then, such understated profits should also be taxed. On
circumspection of Article 9 read with Article 24, the position
which emerges is that the enhancement of income made by virtue
of Article 9 in treating the inhibited transactions between two
enterprises as at arm's length price, cannot be neutralised by the
application of Article 24. In other words, Article 24 applies on all
discriminations as set out in it except those specifically excluded
including Article 9. Reverting to the facts of the instant case, we
find that the assessee is seeking the benefit of article 24 qua the
disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) and not in respect of any transfer
pricing adjustment made by bringing transactions between two
AEs at arm's length price. Disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is an
independent component of the computation of total income which
is distinct from any transfer pricing adjustment. Article 24 read
with Article 9 albeit prohibits the deletion of enhancement of
income due to the making of transactions at ALP, but permits the
deletion of enhancement of income due to disallowance u/s
40(a)(i) of the Act. Be that as it may, we find that the TPO has
not proposed any transfer pricing adjustment in respect of
`Trading segment' of the assessee under which the purchases in
question were made. The addition on account of TP adjustment
is in respect of `Service fee received', which was earned by the
assessee without making purchases of the goods from its AEs.
As disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) is in respect of purchases made from
the AEs, which is in no manner connected with the Commission
segment, we hold that the assessee is entitled to the benefit
provided by article 24 of the DTAA and cannot be visited with
the disallowance u/s 40(a)(i) of the Act.",
Article 24,"Apl Co. Pte Ltd., Mumbai vs Adit (Int'L Taxation)-1(1), Mumbai on 16 February, 2017",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/64892747/?formInput=Article%2024,,"•     Hence, discharge of debt does not amount to discharge
            of debt incurred in respect of a trade or business

      •     The Assessee's contention that Article 24 applies only
            to incomes which are 'exempt from tax' and not to
            incomes which are 'taxable only in one state', by
            making a distinction between the wordings used in
            Article 24 and Article 8 of the DTAA, is rejected holding
            that Art.24 applies only to income which accrues
            outside Singapore and is not remitted to Singapore.



7.   Before us, the ld. Senior Counsel, Mr.Pardiwala after
referring to the relevant phrases used in Article 24 of India-
Singapore DTAA submitted that the provisions of Article 24 are
                                       16                      APL Co. Pte. Ltd.
                                                          ITA No. 4435/Mum/2013
not attracted to income which is governed by Article 8 of DTAA.
The said provision will only apply to an income which is either
""exempt from tax in India"" or ""taxed at a reduced rate"" in India
as per the DTAA. Article 8(1) which deals with taxability of
shipping profits provides that the profits derived by an
enterprise   of   contracting    state        (resident   state)    from   the
operation of ships or aircrafts in international traffic shall be
taxable only in that state (resident state).              This Article gives
exclusive right to tax the shipping profits to the country of
residence.Here, the assessee being a resident of Singapore,
hence, India does not have the right to tax the shipping profits.
There is no exemption of income from shipping income as is
contemplated under Article 24. He submitted that there is a
difference between income being exempt from tax and income
taxable only in one state. By way of illustration, he pointed out
that Articles 20, 21 and 22 of India-Singapore DTAA specifically
provides the incomes which are exempt from tax in a
contracting state. Similarly, the DTAA also provides genres of
income which are taxed at reduced rate, e.g., Article 11 dealing
with interest and Article 12 dealing with Royalty and Fees for
Technical Services. In support of his contention, he strongly
relied upon the decision of ITAT, Mumbai Bench in the case of
SET   Satellite   Singapore     Pte        Ltd.   vs.   ADIT   in   M.A    No.
520/Mum/2010 dated 11.2.2011. He submitted that the freight
earned by assessee is assessable to tax in Singapore under the
domestic laws of Singapore on an accrual basis and not on
remittance basis. Irrespective of remittance of freight income to
Singapore, the entire freight income is assessable to tax in the
hands of APL in Singapore on an accrual basis and not on
remittance basis. Article 24 applies only when income is taxable
                                  17                     APL Co. Pte. Ltd.



                                                ITA No. 4435/Mum/2013
any difference whatsoever even if under the Singapore Income-
tax Act, shipping income is ultimately not taxable.

8.   In support of the aforesaid contentions, Shri Pardiwala
strongly relied on the decision of ITAT, Rajkot Bench in the case
of Alabra Shipping Pte Ltd., 62 taxmann.com 185, wherein
the Tribunal has held that Article 24 has no applicability in the
case of shipping companies operating from Singapore because
the second condition prescribed in Article 24, i.e., taxability of
income in Singapore on receipt basis is not satisfied.The
Tribunal held that there was nothing on record to suggest that
the freight income of assessee was taxable on receipt basis in
Singapore. There also, the Tribunal has relied upon the
Confirmation/Certificate given by IRAS. He pointed out that,
now there is a decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court in the
case of M.T.     Maersk    Mikage    vs. DIT    (IT),   (2016)   72
taxmann.com 359, wherein the Hon‟ble High Court in the
context of India-Singapore DTAA has held that shipping
company‟s income is not taxable in Singapore on the basis of
remittance, albeit on accrual basis and, therefore, para 1 of
Article 24 would not be applicable. While holding so, the Hon‟ble
Court has heavily relied on the letter/confirmation issued by
IRAS which confirmed the taxability of global shipping income
in Singapore on accrual basis. To prove his point, he drew our
specific attention to the various observations made in the said
judgment by their Lordships. As regards the observation of the
ld. CIT(A) that confirmation given by IRAS will not have
significance, he submitted that firstly, whether the assessee‟s
income is taxable in Singapore on accrual basis or remittance
basis is a question of law, which is to be determined having
                                    19                  APL Co. Pte. Ltd.

""only"" debars the other contracting state to tax the shipping
income, that is, India is precluded from taxing the shipping
income even if it is sourced from India. An enterprise which is
tax-resident of Singapore is liable for taxation on its shipping
income only in Singapore and not in India. Whence India does
not have any taxation right on a shipping income of non-
resident entity, which is exclusive domain of the resident state,
there is no question of any kind of exemption or reduced rate of
taxation in the source state. It only envisages territorial and
jurisdictional rights for taxing the income and India has no
jurisdiction for any taxing right which are governed by Article 8.
There is no stipulation about exemption under Article 8 of the
shipping income which as pointed out by ld. Senior Counsel has
been specifically provided in some of the Articles like Article 20,
21 & 22. Hence, it cannot be reckoned that shipping income
earned from India is to be treated as exempt from tax or taxed
at reduced rate, which is a condition precedent for applicability
of Article 24, albeit India at the threshold does not have the
jurisdiction to tax the shipping income of the non-resident
entity. Thus, the condition of Article 24 is not satisfied in the
present case from this angle also. In conclusion, we hold that
the ld. CIT (A) was not justified in denying the benefit of Article
8 by invoking the limitation clause of Article 24 of India-
Singapore DTAA as per our discussion above and most
important, now this issue stands squarely covered by the
decision of Hon'ble Gujarat High Court as referred above. In the
light of our aforesaid finding, we do not deem fit to enter into
the semantics of other findings of Ld. CIT (A) like nexus between
remittance of freight collected in India and finally to Singapore
various and other aspects raised by her and also the various",

ADMINISTER BE REGULATED?

82. Article 25 give to all persons the freedom of conscience and the right
to freely profess, practice and propagate religion. This right, however, is
not absolute. The opening words of Article 25(1) make this right subject to
public order, morality and health, and also to the other provisions of Part
III of the Constitution. This would mean that the right given to a person
under 25(1) can be curtailed or regulated if the exercise of that right
would violate other provisions of Part III of the Constitution, or if the
exercise thereof is to in consonance with public order, morality and
health. The general law made by the government contains provisions relating
to public order, morality and health; these would have to be complied with,
and cannot be violated by any person in exercise of his freedom of
conscience or his freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion. For
example, a person cannot propagate his religion in such a manner as to
denigrate another religion or bring about dissatisfaction amongst people.



83. Article 25(2) gives specific power to the state to make any law
regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other
secular activity, which may be associated with religious practice as
provided by Sub-clause (a) of Article 25(2). This is a further curtailment
of the right to profess, practice and propagate religion conferred on the
persons under Article 25(1). Article 25(2)(a) covers only a limited area
associated with religious practice, in respect of which a law can be made.
A careful reading of Article 25(2)(a) indicates that it does not prevent
the State from making any law in relation to the religious practice as
such. The limited jurisdiction granted by Article 25(2) relates to the
making of a law in relation to economic, financial, political or other
secular activities associated with the religious practice.



84. The freedom to manage religious affairs is provided by Article 26. This
Article gives the right to every religious denomination, or any section
thereof, to exercise the rights that it stipulates. However, this right has
to be exercised in a manner that is in conformity with public order,
morality and health. Clause (a) of Article 26 gives a religious
denomination the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious
and charitable purposes. There is no dispute that the establishment of an
educational institution comes within the meaning of the expression
""charitable purpose"". Therefore, while Article 25(1) grants the freedom of
conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion,
Article 26 can be said to be complementary to it, and provides for every
religious denomination, or any section thereof, to exercise the rights
mentioned therein. This is because Article 26 does not deal with the right
of an individual, but is confined to a religious denomination. Article 26
refers to a denomination of any religion, whether it is a majority or a
minority religion, just as Article 25 refers to all persons, whether they
belong to the majority or a minority religion. Article 26 gives the right
to majority religious denominations, as well as to minority religious
denominations, to exercise the rights contained therein.



100. With reference to Article 29(2), the Court observed at page 1055,
while dealing with an argument based on Article 337 that ""likewise Article
29(2) provides, inter alia, that no citizen shall be denied admission into
any educational institution receiving did out of State funds on grounds
only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them"". Referring to Part
III of the Constitution and to Articles 19 and 25 to 28 in particular, the
Court said:-
"".....Under Article 25 all persons are equally entitled, subject to public
order, morality and health and to the other provisions of Part III, to
freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and
propagate religion. Article 26 confers the fundamental right to every
religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order,
morality and health, to establish and maintain institutions for religious
and charitable purposes, to manage its own affairs in matters of religion,
to acquire property and to administer such property in accordance with law.
The ideal being to constitute India into a secular State, no religious
instruction is, under Article 28(1), to be provided in any educational
institution wholly maintained out of State funds and under Clause (3) of
the same Article no person attending any educational institution recognized
by the State or receiving aid out of State funds is to be required to take
part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution
or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such
institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if
such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto. Article
29(1) confers on any section of the citizens having a distinct language,
script or culture of its own to have the right of conserving the same.
Clause (2) of that Article provides that no citizen shall be denied
admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or
receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste,
language or any of them.""",
Article 25,"The Commissioner, Hindu Religious ... vs Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar Of Sri ... on 16 April, 1954",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1430396/?formInput=Article%2025,,"As  regards	article 19(1)(f) of  the  Constitution,	 the
question   that	 requires  consideration  is,  whether	 the
respondent  as Mathadhipati has a right to property  in	 the
legal	sense,,	 in  the  religious  institution   and	 its
endowments  which would enable him to claim the	 -protection
of  this  article  ? A question is  also  formulated  as  to
whether this article deals with concrete rights of  property
at  all	 ?  So	far as article 25  of  the  Constitution  is
concerned, the point raised is, whether this

article which, it is said, is intended to protect  religious
freedom	 only  so far as individuals are concerned,  can  be
invoked in favour of an institution or Organisation ?	With
regard to article 26, the contention is that a Math does not
come  within the description of a religious denomination  as
provided for in the article and even if it does, what cannot
be interfered with is its right to manage its own affairs in
matters of religion only and nothing else.  It is said, that
the  word it religion "", as used in this article, should  be
taken in its strict etymological sense as distinguished from
any kind of secular activity which may be connected in	some
way with religion on but does not form an essential part  of
it.   Reference is made in this connection to clause  (2)(a)
of article 25 and clause (d) of article 26.  We will take up
these points for consideration one after another.
 As  regards the -property rights of a Mathadhipati, it	 may
not be possible to say in view of the pronouncements of	 the
Judicial Committee, which have been accepted as good law  in
this country ever since 1921, that a Mathadhipati holds	 the
Math  property	as  a lifetenant or  that  his	position  is
similar to that of a Hindu widow in respect to her husband's
estate	or of an English BishoP holding a benefice.   He  is
certainly not a trustee in the strict sense.  He may be,  as
the  Privy Council(1), says, a manager or custodian, of	 the
institution who has to discharge the duties of a trustee and
is  answerable as such; but he is not a mere manager and  it
would not be right to describe Mahantship as a mere office.""
A  superior  of a Math has not only duties to  discharge  in
connection with the endowment but he has a personal interest
of a beneficial character which is sanctioned by custom	 and
is  much  larger  than that of a  Shebait  in  the  debutter
property.  It was held by a Full Bench of the Calcutta	High
Court(2),  that	 Shebaitship. itself is property,  and	this
decision was approved of by the Judicial Committee in Ganesh
v Lal Behary(3), and again in Bhabatarini v. Ashalata(4).

(2)  Vide Monahai v. Bhupendra, 60 Cal. 452.



    We	now  come  to  article 25  which,  as  its  language
indicates, secures to every person, subject to public order,
health	and morality, a freedom not only to  entertain	such
religious belief, as may be approved of by his judgment	 and
conscience,  but also to exhibit his belief in such  outward
acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his
ideas  for the edification of others.  A question is  raised
as to whether the word ""persons"" here means individuals only
or includes corporate bodies as well.  The question, in	 our
opinion, is not at all relevant for our present purpose.   A
Mathadhipati  is certainly not a corporate body; he  is	 the
head  of a spiritual fraternity and by virtue of his  office
has to perform the duties of a religious teacher. it is	 his
duty  to  practise and propagate the  religious	 tenets,  of
which he is an adherent and if any provision of law prevents
him  from  propagating his doctrines, that  would  certainly
affect	the religious freedom which is guaranteed  to  every
person	under  article 25.   Institutions  as	such  cannot
practise  or  propagate	 religion; it can be  done  only  by
individual persons and whether these person propagate  their
personal  views	 or  the tenets for  which  the	 institution
stands is really immaterial for purposes. of article 25.  It
is  the propagation of belief that is protected,  no  matter
whether	  the  propagation  takes  place  in  a	 church	  or
monastery, or in a temple or parlour meeting.
As  regards  article 26, the first question is, what is	 the
precise meaning or connotation of the expression


""religious  denomination""  and	whether a  Math	 could	come
within	this expression.  The word ""denomination""  has	been
defined	 in the Oxford Dictionary to mean 'Ca collection  of
individuals  classed  together	under	the  same  name:   a
religious   sect   or  body  having  a	common	 faith	 and
Organisation  and designated by a  distinctive name.  It  is
well known that the practice of setting up Maths as  centres
of  the logical teaching was started by	 Shri  Sankaracharya
and  was  followed by various teachers	since  then.   After
Sankara,   came	  a  galaxy  of	  religious   teachers	 and
philosophers  who founded the different sects and  sub-sects
of  the Hindu religion that we find in India at the  present
day.   Each one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly  be
balled	a religious denomination, as it is designated  by  a
distinctive  name,-in  many  cases it is  the  name  of	 the
founder,-and  has  a  common  faith  and  common   spiritual
organization.	The followers of Ramanuja, who are known  by
the  name  of  Shri  Vaishnabas,  undoubtedly  constitute  a
religious   denomination;  and	so  do	the   followers	  of
Madhwacharya  and  other religious teachers.  It is  a	fact
well  established  by tradition that the eight	Udipi  Maths
were  founded by Madhwacharya himself and the  trustees	 and
the beneficiaries of these Maths profess to be followers  of
that  teacher.	 The High Court has found that the  Math  in
question is in charge of the Sivalli Brahmins who constitute
a  section of the followers of Madhwacharya.  As article  26
contemplates not merely a religious denomination but also  a
section	 thereof,  the	Math  or  the  spiritual  fraternity
represented  by it can legitimately come within the  purview
of this article.



(b),  the  next	 two clauses of article 26  guarantee  to  a
religious denomination the right to acquire and own property
and to administer such property in accordance with law.	 The
administration	of its property by a religious	denomination
has  thus been placed on a different footing from the  right
to  manage  its	 own affairs in matters	 of  religion.	 The
latter is a fundamental right which no legislature can	take
away, whereas the former can be regulated by laws which	 the
legislature  can  validly impose.  It is  clear,  therefore,
that   questions  merely  relating  to	 administration	  of
properties belonging to a religious group or institution are
not  matters of religion to which clause (b) of the  article
applies.   What	 then  are matters of religion	?  The	word
""religion "" has not been defined in the Constitution and  it
is  a  term  which  is	hardly	susceptible  of	 any   rigid
definition.  In an American case(1), it has been said "" that
the  term  religion  has reference to  one's  views  of	 his
relation  to his Creator and to the obligations they  impose
of reverence for His Being and character and of obedience to
His  will.   It is often confounded with cultus of  form  or
worship	 of a particular sect, but is  distinguishable	from
the  latter."" We do not think that the above definition	 can
be regarded as either precise or adequate.  Articles 25	 and
26  of	our Constitution are based for the  most  part	upon
article 44(2) of the Constitution of Eire and we have  great
doubt  whether	a definition of ""religion""  as	given  above
could have been in the minds of our Constitution-makers when
they  framed  the  Constitution.  Religion  is	certainly  a
matter	of faith with individuals or communities and  it  is
not necessarily theistic.  There are well known religions in
India like Buddhism and Jainism which do not believe in	 God
or  in any Intelligent First Cause.  A religion	 undoubtedly
has its basis in a system of beliefs or doctrines which	 are
regarded by those who profess that religion as conducive  to
their  spiritual well being, but it would not be correct  to
say that religion is nothing else, but a
(1)  Vide Davie v. Benson 133 U.S 333 at 342.



   These  observations	apply  fully to	 the  protection  of
religion   as	guaranteed  by	the   Indian   Constitution.
Restrictions by the State upon free exercise of religion are
permitted both under articles 25 and 26 on grounds of public
order,.	 morality and health.  Clause (2)(a) of	 article 25
reserves the right of the State to regulate or restrict	 any
economic, financial, political and other secular  activities
which may be associated with religious practice and there is
a  further right given to the State by sub-clause (b)  under
which the State can

116, 127

legislate  for social welfare and reform even though  by  so
doing  it  might interfere with	 religious  practices.	 The
learned	 Attorney-General lays stress upon clause (2)(a)  of
the   article  and  his	 contention  is	 that  all   secular
activities, which may be associated with religion but do not
really	constitute an essential part of it, are amenable  to
State regulation.",

The provision if it violates Article 25 ?



It was then submitted that the personal law of muslims 

permits performance of marriages with 4 women, obviously for 

the purpose of procreating children and any restriction thereon 

would be violative of right to freedom of religion enshrined in 

Article 25 of the Constitution.  The relevant part of Article 25 

reads as under:-




The meaning of religion - the term as employed in Article
25 and the nature of protection conferred by Article 25 stands 

settled by the pronouncement of the Constitution Bench decision 

in Dr. M. Ismail Faruqui and Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors.  

(1994) 6 SCC 360.  The protection under Articles 25 and 26 of 

the Constitution is with respect to religious practice which forms 

an essential and integral part of the religion.     A practice may 

be a religious practice but not an essential and  integral part of 

practice of that religion.  The latter is not protected by Article



25.



In Sarla Mudgal (Smt.), President, Kalyani and Ors. 

Vs. Union of India and Ors. (1995) 3 SCC 635, this Court has 

judicially noticed it being acclaimed in the United States of 

America that the practice of polygamy is injurious to 'public 

morals', even though some religions may make it obligatory or 

desirable for its followers.  The Court held that polygamy can be 

superseded by the State just as it can prohibit human sacrifice 

or the practice of Sati in the interest of public order.  The 

Personal Law operates under the authority of the legislation and 

not under the religion and, therefore, the Personal Law can 

always be superseded or supplemented by legislation.
In Mohd. Ahmed Khan Vs. Shah Bano Begum and 

Ors., (1985) 2 SCC 556, the Constitution Bench was confronted 

with a canvassed conflict between the provisions of Section 125 

of Cr.P.C. and Muslim Personal Law.  The question was: when 

the Personal Law makes a provision for maintenance to a 

divorced wife, the provision for maintenance under Section 125 

of Cr.P.C. would run in conflict with the Personal Law.  The 

Constitution Bench laid down two principles; firstly, the two 

provisions operate in different fields and, therefore, there is no 

conflict and; secondly, even if there is a conflict it should be set 

at rest by holding that the statutory law will prevail over the 

Personal Law of the parties, in cases where they are in conflict.
In Mohd. Hanif Quareshi & Ors. Vs. The State of 

Bihar, (1959) SCR 629, the State Legislation placing a total ban 

on cow slaughter was under challenge.  One of the submissions 

made was that such a ban offended Article 25 of the 

Constitution because such ban came in the way of the sacrifice 

of a cow on a particular day where it was considered to be 

religious by Muslims.  Having made a review of various religious 

books, the Court concluded that it did not appear to be 

obligatory that a person must sacrifice a cow.  It was optional 

for a Muslim to do so.  The fact of an option seems to run 

counter to the notion of an obligatory duty.  Many Muslims do 

not sacrifice a cow on the Id day.  As it was not proved that the 

sacrifice of a cow on a particular day was an obligatory overt act 

for a Mussalman for the performance of his religious beliefs and 

ideas, it could not be held that a total ban on the slaughter of 

cows ran counter to Article 25 of the Constitution.
In The State of Bombay Vs. Narasu Appa Mali, AIR 

1952 Bombay 84, the constitutional validity of the Bombay 

Prevention of Hindu Bigamous Marriages Act (XXV (25) of 1946) 

was challenged on the ground of violation of Article 14, 15 and 

25 of the Constitution.  A Division Bench, consisting of Chief 

Justice Chagla and Justice Gajendragadkar (as His Lordship then 

was), held -





Rule 21 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 

1964 restrains any government servant having a living spouse 

from entering into or contracting a marriage with any person.  A 

similar provision is to be found in several service rules framed  

by the States governing the conduct of their civil servants.  No 

decided case of this court has been brought to our notice 

wherein the constitutional validity of such provisions may have 

been put in issue on the ground of violating the freedom of 

religion under Article 25 or the freedom of personal life and 

liberty under Article 21.  Such a challenge was never laid before 

this Court apparently because of its futility.  However, a few 

decisions by the High Courts may be noticed.",
Article 25,"Pannalal Bansilal Pitti & Ors. Etc vs State Of Andhra Pradesh & Anr on 17 January, 1996",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1494202/?formInput=Article%2025,,"The main thrust of the arguments of the learned counsel
is that	 Articles 25  and 26  guarantee	 freedom  to  manage
religious affairs  and right to freely profess, practise and
propagate  the	 religion  to  all  citizens  alike.  Hindus
constitute majority  population and  Hindu religion  is	 the
major religion in the country. Equally Muslim, Christian and
Parsee citizens	 are entitled  to the similar constitutional
rights under  Articles 25  and	 26.  Without  touching	 the
administration and  governance of  charitable  or  religious
institutions or endowments founded or maintained by Muslims,
Christians   or	   Parsees   making   law   regulating	 the
administration of  Hindu religious  institutions  and  above
endowments  offends   Articles	 14   and   15(1)   of	 the
Constitution. It is also contended that when a denomination,
which is  a part  of the  major	 religion  is  protected  by
Article 26,  the major	religions themselves  as  genus	 are
entitled to  the  protection  of  Article  26.	Institutions
belonging to  them cannot, therefore, be regulated under the
law  offending	 their	right	to  religious  practice.  By
operation of  clause (2)  of  Article 25,  law	 of  general
application in	respect of  religious institutions should be
made  and   singling  out   the	 religious  institutions  or
endowments  established	 and  maintained  by  Hindus  is  an
invidious   discrimination   violating	 Article   14.	 The
regulation of administration and governance of the religious
institutions or	 endowments would  amount to  restriction on
the  religious	practices  or  freedom	of  religion,  since
establishment,	maintenance   and  administration   of	 the
religious institutions	and endowments	are intertwined with
the very  religious faith itself. It is impermissible for an
outside agency	or the	party like the State to determine as
to which  activity is  essential part  of religion and which
part is	 not. It  would not, therefore, be open to the State
to restrict  or prohibit,  under the  guise of	its  secular
power, the  administration of  the religious  or  charitable
institutions or endowments, country to what the followers of
the  religion	believe	 to   be  the  religious  duty.	 The
administration of  religious or	 charitable institution	 and
endowments as  part of the religious practice, perceived and
rigorously followed by Hindus cannot, therefore, be divested
by legislation.



     The second question is: whether abolition of hereditary
trusteeship violates Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.
Article 25(1) assures, subject to public order, morality and
health and  to the  other provisions of Chapter III that all
persons are  equally entitled  to freedom  of conscience and
the  right   freely  to	  profess,  practice  and  propagate
religion. Sub-clause  (2) of  Article 25 saves the operation
of the	existing law  and also	frees the State from Article
25(1)  to   make  any  law  regulating	or  restricting	 any
economic, financial,  political or  other secular  activity,
which may  be associated  with religious  practice. Equally,
law may	 provide for social welfare and reform, the throwing
open of	 Hindu religious  institutions of a public character
to all classes and sections of the society. Article 26 gives
freedom to  manage  religious  affairs,	 subject  to  public
order, morality	 and health, every religious denomination or
any section  thereof to establish institutions for religious
and charitable purpose, to manage its own affairs in matters
of religion,  to  own  and  acquire  movable  and  immovable
property and  to administer such property in accordance with
law.



 In The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras
vs. Sri	 Lakshmindra Thirtha  Swamiar  of  Sri	Shirur	Mutt
[(1954) S.C.R.	1005], known as Shirur Mutt case, this Court
had held that the language of Article 25 indicates to secure
to  every   person  subject  to	 public	 order,	 health	 and
morality, a  freedom not  only to  entertain such  religious
belief,	 as   may  be	approved  of  by  his  judgment	 and
conscience, but	 also to  exhibit his belief in such outward
acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his
ideas for  the edification  of others. It is the propagation
of  belief   that  is	protected,  no	matter	whether	 the
propagation takes  place in  a church,	or monastery or in a
temple or  parlour meeting.  At page  1023, it was held that
the word ""religion"" has not been defined in the Constitution
and it	is a  term which  is hardly susceptible of any rigid
definition. Religion  is certainly  a matter  of faith	with
individuals  or	  communities  and  it	is  not	 necessarily
theistic. Religion,  undoubtedly, has  its basis in a system
of beliefs  or doctrines  which are  regarded by  those	 who
profess that  religion conducive  to  their  spiritual	well
being. A  religion may	not only  lay down a code of ethical
rules for  its	followers  to  accept,	it  might  prescribe
rituals and  observances, ceremonies  and modes	 of  worship
etc. guarantee	under the Constitution not only protects the
freedom of  religious  denomination  but  it  also  protects
ceremonies and	modes  of  worship  which  are	regarded  as
integral parts	of religion;  and the forms and observations
might extend  even to  interests of  food  and	dress.	What
Article 25(2)  (a) contemplates	 is not	 regulation  by	 the
State of  religious practices  as such, the freedom of which
is guaranteed by the Constitution. The guarantee is in-built
to every religion to establish and maintain institutions for
religious and  charitable purposes  and their  management in
matters of religion to own and acquire movable and immovable
properties. But	 they are  subject to  Article 25  and other
provisions of the Constitution.



     Hindus are	 majority in  population and  Hinduism is  a
major religion.	 While Articles 25 and 26 granted religious
freedom to  minority religions	like Islam, Christianity and
Judaism, they  do not  intend to  deny the same guarantee to
Hindus. Therefore,  protection under  Articles 25  and 26 is
available to  the people  professing Hindu religion, subject
to the	law therein.  The right to establish a religious and
charitable institution	is a  part of  religious  belief  or
faith and,  though law	made under  clause (2) of Article 25
may impose  restrictions on  the exercise of that right, the
right to  administer and  maintain such	 institution  cannot
altogether be  taken away  and vested  in other	 party; more
particularly, in  the officers	of a secular Government. The
administration of  religious  institution  or  endowment  or
specific endowment  being a  secular activity,	it is not an
essential part	of religion  and, therefore, the legislature
is competent  to enact	law, as	 in Part  III  of  the	Act,
regulating  the	  administration  and	governance  of	 the
religious or  charitable institutions or endowment. They are
not part  of religious	practices or customs. The State does
not directly  undertake their  administration and expend any
public money  for maintenance  and governance  thereof.	 Law
regulates  appropriately   for	 efficient   management	  or
administration	or   governance	 of   charitable  and  Hindu
religious institutions or endowments or specific endowments,
through its officers or officers appointed under the Act.",
Article 25,"Christian Medical College Vellore & Ors vs Union Of India And Ors on 18 July, 2013",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/54508777/?formInput=Article%2025,,"15.     Mr. Salve submitted that  the  two  Notifications  both  dated  21st
December, 2010, incorporating amendments  in  the  Regulations  on  Graduate
Medical  Education,   1997   and   the   Post-Graduate   Medical   Education
Regulations,  2000,  and  introducing  a  single  National  Eligibility-cum-
Entrance Test (NEET) for admission to the MBBS course and the  Post-graduate
course in each academic year throughout the country, had been challenged  by
the Petitioners before the Madras High Court, in Writ Petition Nos.24109  of
2011 and 24110 of 2011.  Mr. Salve urged that the  said  amendments  stifled
and stultified the fundamental rights  guaranteed  to  religious  minorities
under Articles 25, 26, 29(1) and 30  of  the  Constitution  of  India.   Mr.
Salve submitted that Article 25 secures to every person, subject  to  public
order, health and morality and to the other provisions of  Part-III  of  the
Constitution, freedom  of  conscience  and  the  right  freely  to  profess,
practise and propagate religion.  The said right guarantees to every  person
freedom not only to entertain such religious belief,  but  also  to  exhibit
his belief in such outward acts as he thought proper  and  to  propagate  or
disseminate his ideas for the edification of others.  Mr. Salve  urged  that
this proposition was settled by this Court as far  back  as  in  1954  by  a
Bench of  Seven-Judges  in   Commr.,  H.R.E.  Vs.  Sri  Lakshmindra  Thirtha
Swamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt [1954 SCR 1005].



33.     It was further submitted that all the Petitioners in this  batch  of
cases are either religious minority educational institutions  or  linguistic
minority institutions; non-minority self-financing colleges,  self-financing
""Deemed to be  Universities""  under  Section  3  of  the  University  Grants
Commission Act and the State Governments which run State  medical  colleges.
However, it is the Christian Medical College, Vellore, which  is  among  the
very few institutions that fall in the first category.  The learned  counsel
urged  that without demur, the Christian Medical College, Vellore, has  been
consistently rated among the top ten medical colleges  in  the  country  and
usually ranked first or second. The excellence of patient care and  academic
training has been  recognised,  both  at  the  national   and  international
levels, and its contribution to health research has also been recognised  as
pioneering  work  by  both  national  and  international  research   funding
agencies.  Mr. Salve submitted  that  a  part  of  the  teachings  of  Jesus
Christ, as documented in the Gospels, which form part of the New  Testament,
was to  reach  out  to  and  to  heal  the  sick,  which  command  has  been
institutionalised by the Petitioner ever since it was established as a  one-
bed mission clinic-cum-hospital  in  1900.  Mr.  Salve  submitted  that  the
activities of the Petitioner Institution clearly attract the provisions   of
Article 25 of the Constitution and through the  Christian  Medical  College,
Vellore, its activities are designed to  achieve  the  avowed  objective  of
providing human resources for  the  healing  ministry  of  the  Church.  The
activity of running medical courses and allied health sciences  and  nursing
courses, in order to ensure constant  supply  of  doctors  and  other  para-
medical staff to those hospitals, engaged in the healing of  the  sick,  are
acts performed by the Petitioner in furtherance of its religious  faith  and
beliefs. It was submitted that in the decision of the Constitution Bench  of
Seven  Hon'ble  Judges  in  the  case  of  Commissioner,   Hindu   Religious
Endowments, Madras Vs. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar of  Sri  Shirur  Mutt
(1954 SCR 1005), this Court  held  that  Article 25  of  the  Constitution,
protects not only the freedom  of religious opinion, but also acts  done  in
pursuance of religious beliefs, as is clear from  the  expression  ""practice
of religion"".



42.      Mr. Salve urged that the amended provisions of the MCI  Regulations
as impugned, were liable  to  be  struck  down  as  being  contrary  to  the
provisions of Articles 25,  26  and  30  of  the  Constitution,  read  with
Sections 10A and 19A of the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.

43.     Having heard Mr. Harish Salve on the  rights  claimed  by  religious
minority medical institution enjoying the protection  of  Articles 25,  26,
29(1) and 30 of the Constitution, we may now turn to  the  submissions  made
by Mr. K. Parasaran, learned Senior Advocate, appearing  on  behalf  of  the
Vinayaka Missions University, run by a linguistic  minority,  also  enjoying
the rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(g) and the protection  of  Article
30 of the Constitution.



 Mr. Gupta urged that as far as the application of  Articles 25  and
26  of  the  Constitution  in  matters   relating   to   establishment   and
administration of educational institutions is concerned, the same has to  be
read in relation to matters  of  religion  and  with  respect  to  religious
practices which form an essential and integral part  of  religion.   Learned
counsel submitted that the rights protected under Articles 25  and  26  are
available to individuals and not to organized bodies, such as CMC,  Vellore,
or other minority run institutions, as  had  been  held  by  this  Court  in
Sardar Vs. State of  Bombay  [1962  Supp.  (2)  SCR  496],  wherein  it  was
observed that the right guaranteed by Article 25  is  an  individual  right.
The said view was subsequently endorsed in Sri Sri Sri Lakshmana  Yatendrulu
Vs. State of A.P. [(196) 8 SCC  705].   Mr.  Gupta  submitted  that,  having
regard to the above, the various  associations  and  minorities,  which  had
challenged the impugned Regulations, were not entitled to do  so  and  their
applications were liable to be dismissed.",

Article 26,"T.M.A.Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/512761/?formInput=Article%2026,,"1. IS THERE A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO SET UP EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION AND IF
SO, UNDER WHICH PROVISION?

18. With regard to the establishment of educational institutions, three
Articles of the Constitution come into play. Article 19(1)(g) gives the
right to all the citizens to practice any profession or to carry on any
occupation, trade or business; this right is subject to restrictions that
may be placed under Article 19(6). Article 26 gives the right to every
religious denomination to establish and maintain an institution for
religious purposes, which would include an educational institution. Article
19(1)(g) and Article 26, therefore, confer rights on all citizens and
religious denominations to establish and maintain educational institutions.
There was no serious dispute that the majority community as well as
linguistic and religious minorities would have a right under Article 19(1)



84. The freedom to manage religious affairs is provided by Article 26. This
Article gives the right to every religious denomination, or any section
thereof, to exercise the rights that it stipulates. However, this right has
to be exercised in a manner that is in conformity with public order,
morality and health. Clause (a) of Article 26 gives a religious
denomination the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious
and charitable purposes. There is no dispute that the establishment of an
educational institution comes within the meaning of the expression
""charitable purpose"". Therefore, while Article 25(1) grants the freedom of
conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion,
Article 26 can be said to be complementary to it, and provides for every
religious denomination, or any section thereof, to exercise the rights
mentioned therein. This is because Article 26 does not deal with the right
of an individual, but is confined to a religious denomination. Article 26
refers to a denomination of any religion, whether it is a majority or a
minority religion, just as Article 25 refers to all persons, whether they
belong to the majority or a minority religion. Article 26 gives the right
to majority religious denominations, as well as to minority religious
denominations, to exercise the rights contained therein.



91. The right of the minorities to establish and administer educational
institutions is provided for by Article 30(1). To some extent, Article
26(1)(a) and Article 30(1) overlap, insofar as they relate to the
establishment of educational institutions but whereas Article 26 gives the
right both to the majority as well as minority communities to establish and
maintain institutions for charitable purposes, which would inter alia,
include educational institutions, Article 30(1) refers to the right of
minorities to establish and maintain educational institutions of their
choice. Another difference between Article 26 and Article 30 is that
whereas Article 26 refers only to religious denominations, Article 30
contains the right of religious as well as linguistic minorities to
establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.



92. Article 30(1) bestows on the minorities, whether based on religion or
language, the right to establish and administer educational institution of
their choice. Unlike Article 25 and 26, Article 30(1) does not specifically
state that the right under Article 30(1) is subject to public order,
morality and health or to other provisions of Part III. This Sub-Article
also does not specifically mention that the right to establish and
administer a minority educational institution would be subject to any rules
or regulations.",
Article 26,"The Commissioner, Hindu Religious ... vs Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar Of Sri ... on 16 April, 1954",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1430396/?formInput=Article%2026,,"(b)  and (c) of article 26 of the Constitution.	 Section  99
vests  a revisional jurisdiction in the Government  to	call
for  and examine the records of the Commissioner  and  other
subordinate  authorities  to satisfy themselves	 as  to	 the
regularity  and	 propriety of any proceeding  taken  or	 any
order  or  decision made by them These, in  brief,  are	 the
provisions of the Act material for our present purpose.
    The learned Judges of the High Court have taken the view
that the respondent as Mathadhipati has certain well defined
rights in the institution and its endowments which could  be
regarded as rights to property within the meaning of article
19(1)(f) of the Constitution.  The provisions of the Act  to
the extent that they take away or unduly restrict the  power
to  exercise  these rights are not  reasonable	restrictions
within the meaning of article 19(5) and must consequently be
held  invalid.	The High Court has held in the second  place
that the respondent, as the head and

representative	of  a  religious institution,  has  a  right
guaranteed  to him under article 25 of the  Constitution  to
practise  and propagate freely the religion of which he	 and
his  followers profess to be adherents.	 This right, in	 the
opinion of the High Court, has been affected by some of	 the
provisions of the Act.	The High Court has held further that
the  Math in question is really an institution belonging  to
Sivalli	 Brahmins,  who are a section of  the  followers  of
Madhwacharya and hence constitutes a religious	denomination
within the meaning of article 26 of the Constitution.	This
religious denomination has a fundamental right under article
26 to manage its own affairs in matters of religion  through
the  Mathadhipati who is their spiritual head and  superior,
and  those provisions of the Act, which	 substantially	take
away the rights of the Mathadhipati in this respect,  amount
to  violation  of  the fundamental  right  guaranteed  under
article 26.   Lastly,	the High Court has.  held  that	 the
provision for compulsory contribution made in section 76  of
the  Act  comes	 within the mischief of article	 27  of	 the
Constitution.	This last point raises a wide issue  and  We
propose	 to discuss it separately later on.  So far  as	 the
other  three points are concerned, we will have	 to  examine
first  of all the general contentions that have been  raised
by the learned Attorney-General, who appeared for the  Union
of India as an intervener in this and other connected cases,
and the questions raised are, whether these articles of	 the
Constitution  are at all available to the respondent in	 the
present	 case  and  whether they  give	him  any  protection
regarding  the rights and privileges, of the  infraction  of
which he complains.



   As  regards	article 19(1)(f) of  the  Constitution,	 the
question   that	 requires  consideration  is,  whether	 the
respondent  as Mathadhipati has a right to property  in	 the
legal	sense,,	 in  the  religious  institution   and	 its
endowments  which would enable him to claim the	 -protection
of  this  article  ? A question is  also  formulated  as  to
whether this article deals with concrete rights of  property
at  all	 ?  So	far as article 25  of  the  Constitution  is
concerned, the point raised is, whether this

article which, it is said, is intended to protect  religious
freedom	 only  so far as individuals are concerned,  can  be
invoked in favour of an institution or Organisation ?	With
regard to article 26, the contention is that a Math does not
come  within the description of a religious denomination  as
provided for in the article and even if it does, what cannot
be interfered with is its right to manage its own affairs in
matters of religion only and nothing else.  It is said, that
the  word it religion "", as used in this article, should  be
taken in its strict etymological sense as distinguished from
any kind of secular activity which may be connected in	some
way with religion on but does not form an essential part  of
it.   Reference is made in this connection to clause  (2)(a)
of article 25 and clause (d) of article 26.  We will take up
these points for consideration one after another.
 As  regards the -property rights of a Mathadhipati, it	 may
not be possible to say in view of the pronouncements of	 the
Judicial Committee, which have been accepted as good law  in
this country ever since 1921, that a Mathadhipati holds	 the
Math  property	as  a lifetenant or  that  his	position  is
similar to that of a Hindu widow in respect to her husband's
estate	or of an English BishoP holding a benefice.   He  is
certainly not a trustee in the strict sense.  He may be,  as
the  Privy Council(1), says, a manager or custodian, of	 the
institution who has to discharge the duties of a trustee and
is  answerable as such; but he is not a mere manager and  it
would not be right to describe Mahantship as a mere office.""
A  superior  of a Math has not only duties to  discharge  in
connection with the endowment but he has a personal interest
of a beneficial character which is sanctioned by custom	 and
is  much  larger  than that of a  Shebait  in  the  debutter
property.  It was held by a Full Bench of the Calcutta	High
Court(2),  that	 Shebaitship. itself is property,  and	this
decision was approved of by the Judicial Committee in Ganesh
v Lal Behary(3), and again in Bhabatarini v. Ashalata(4).

(2)  Vide Monahai v. Bhupendra, 60 Cal. 452.



    We	now  come  to  article 25  which,  as  its  language
indicates, secures to every person, subject to public order,
health	and morality, a freedom not only to  entertain	such
religious belief, as may be approved of by his judgment	 and
conscience,  but also to exhibit his belief in such  outward
acts as he thinks proper and to propagate or disseminate his
ideas  for the edification of others.  A question is  raised
as to whether the word ""persons"" here means individuals only
or includes corporate bodies as well.  The question, in	 our
opinion, is not at all relevant for our present purpose.   A
Mathadhipati  is certainly not a corporate body; he  is	 the
head  of a spiritual fraternity and by virtue of his  office
has to perform the duties of a religious teacher. it is	 his
duty  to  practise and propagate the  religious	 tenets,  of
which he is an adherent and if any provision of law prevents
him  from  propagating his doctrines, that  would  certainly
affect	the religious freedom which is guaranteed  to  every
person	under  article	25.   Institutions  as	such  cannot
practise  or  propagate	 religion; it can be  done  only  by
individual persons and whether these person propagate  their
personal  views	 or  the tenets for  which  the	 institution
stands is really immaterial for purposes. of article 25.  It
is  the propagation of belief that is protected,  no  matter
whether	  the  propagation  takes  place  in  a	 church	  or
monastery, or in a temple or parlour meeting.
As  regards  article 26, the first question is, what is	 the
precise meaning or connotation of the expression


""religious  denomination""  and	whether a  Math	 could	come
within	this expression.  The word ""denomination""  has	been
defined	 in the Oxford Dictionary to mean 'Ca collection  of
individuals  classed  together	under	the  same  name:   a
religious   sect   or  body  having  a	common	 faith	 and
Organisation  and designated by a  distinctive name.  It  is
well known that the practice of setting up Maths as  centres
of  the logical teaching was started by	 Shri  Sankaracharya
and  was  followed by various teachers	since  then.   After
Sankara,   came	  a  galaxy  of	  religious   teachers	 and
philosophers  who founded the different sects and  sub-sects
of  the Hindu religion that we find in India at the  present
day.   Each one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly  be
balled	a religious denomination, as it is designated  by  a
distinctive  name,-in  many  cases it is  the  name  of	 the
founder,-and  has  a  common  faith  and  common   spiritual
organization.	The followers of Ramanuja, who are known  by
the  name  of  Shri  Vaishnabas,  undoubtedly  constitute  a
religious   denomination;  and	so  do	the   followers	  of
Madhwacharya  and  other religious teachers.  It is  a	fact
well  established  by tradition that the eight	Udipi  Maths
were  founded by Madhwacharya himself and the  trustees	 and
the beneficiaries of these Maths profess to be followers  of
that  teacher.	 The High Court has found that the  Math  in
question is in charge of the Sivalli Brahmins who constitute
a  section of the followers of Madhwacharya.  As article 26
contemplates not merely a religious denomination but also  a
section	 thereof,  the	Math  or  the  spiritual  fraternity
represented  by it can legitimately come within the  purview
of this article.



1029
interfere  with their decision in such matters.	 Of  course,
the  scale  of expenses to be incurred	in  connection	with
these	religious   observances	 would	be   a	 matter	  of
administration	of  property  belonging	 to  the   religious
denomination and can be controlled by secular authorities in
accordance   with   any	 law  laid  down  by   a   competent
legislature;  for  it could not be the	injunction,  of	 any
religion  to destroy the institution and its  endowments  by
incurring wasteful expenditure on rites and ceremonies.	  It
should be noticed, however, that under article 26(d), it  is
the  fundamental  right of a religious denomination  or	 its
representative	to administer its properties  in  accordance
with  law; and the law, therefore, must leave the  right  of
administration to the religious denomination itself  subject
to  such restrictions and regulations as it might choose  to
impose.	 A law which takes away the right of  administration
from  the hands of a religious denomination  altogether	 and
vests it in any other authority would amount to a  violation
of the right guaranteed under clause (d) of article 26.
   Having thus disposed of the general contentions that were
raised	in this appeal, we will proceed now to	examine	 the
specific grounds that have been urged by the parties  before
us in regard to the decision of the High Court so far as  it
declared  several sections of the new Act to be ultra  vires
the  Constitution  by reason of their conflicting  with	 the
fundamental  rights  of	 the  respondent.   The	  concluding
portion of the judgment of the High Court where the  learned
Judges	summed	up their decision on this  point  stands  as
follows:",
Article 26,"THE CONSTITUTION (FORTY-SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1976",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/50073852/,,,

is that	 Articles 25  and 26  guarantee	 freedom  to  manage
religious affairs  and right to freely profess, practise and
propagate  the	 religion  to  all  citizens  alike.  Hindus
constitute majority  population and  Hindu religion  is	 the
major religion in the country. Equally Muslim, Christian and
Parsee citizens	 are entitled  to the similar constitutional
rights under  Articles	25  and	 26.  Without  touching	 the
administration and  governance of  charitable  or  religious
institutions or endowments founded or maintained by Muslims,
Christians   or	   Parsees   making   law   regulating	 the
administration of  Hindu religious  institutions  and  above
endowments  offends   Articles	 14   and   15(1)   of	 the
Constitution. It is also contended that when a denomination,
which is  a part  of the  major	 religion  is  protected  by
Article 26,  the major	religions themselves  as  genus	 are
entitled to  the  protection  of  Article 26.	Institutions
belonging to  them cannot, therefore, be regulated under the
law  offending	 their	right	to  religious  practice.  By
operation of  clause (2)  of  Article  25,  law	 of  general
application in	respect of  religious institutions should be
made  and   singling  out   the	 religious  institutions  or
endowments  established	 and  maintained  by  Hindus  is  an
invidious   discrimination   violating	 Article   14.	 The
regulation of administration and governance of the religious
institutions or	 endowments would  amount to  restriction on
the  religious	practices  or  freedom	of  religion,  since
establishment,	maintenance   and  administration   of	 the
religious institutions	and endowments	are intertwined with
the very  religious faith itself. It is impermissible for an
outside agency	or the	party like the State to determine as
to which  activity is  essential part  of religion and which
part is	 not. It  would not, therefore, be open to the State
to restrict  or prohibit,  under the  guise of	its  secular
power, the  administration of  the religious  or  charitable
institutions or endowments, country to what the followers of
the  religion	believe	 to   be  the  religious  duty.	 The
administration of  religious or	 charitable institution	 and
endowments as  part of the religious practice, perceived and
rigorously followed by Hindus cannot, therefore, be divested
by legislation.



     The second question is: whether abolition of hereditary
trusteeship violates Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.
Article 25(1) assures, subject to public order, morality and
health and  to the  other provisions of Chapter III that all
persons are  equally entitled  to freedom  of conscience and
the  right   freely  to	  profess,  practice  and  propagate
religion. Sub-clause  (2) of  Article 25 saves the operation
of the	existing law  and also	frees the State from Article
25(1)  to   make  any  law  regulating	or  restricting	 any
economic, financial,  political or  other secular  activity,
which may  be associated  with religious  practice. Equally,
law may	 provide for social welfare and reform, the throwing
open of	 Hindu religious  institutions of a public character
to all classes and sections of the society. Article 26 gives
freedom to  manage  religious  affairs,	 subject  to  public
order, morality	 and health, every religious denomination or
any section  thereof to establish institutions for religious
and charitable purpose, to manage its own affairs in matters
of religion,  to  own  and  acquire  movable  and  immovable
property and  to administer such property in accordance with
law.

     Charity shall be done by all; especially
     when one  has the	means  he  should  do
     charity   without	  fail	  on	every
     occasions.""
     Hindu Piety  found expression  in establishing temples,
creation of  endowments or  specific endowments, by gifts to
idols and images consecrated and installed in temples and to
religious institutions	of every kind. The word `charity' in
a legal sense includes every gift for educational, a general
public use,  to be applied consistent with existing laws for
the benefit  of an indefinite number of persons and designed
to benefit  them from a religious, moral, physical or social
stand-point -  vide Black's  Law  Dictionary  at  page	233.
Therefore, every  Hindu imbued	with religious or charitable
disposition and	 pious wish  would  create  or	establish  a
charitable or religious institution or endowment or specific
endowments for	general public	use to be applied consistent
with the  law for  the benefit	of an  indefinite number  of
people or  persons and	designed to  benefit the  religious,
moral and  social stand-point  equally of educational stand-
point. Therefore,  a Hindu  who has  founded a	religious or
charitable institution	or endowment has a fundamental right
to administer  it in  accordance with  law; and	 so, the law
must leave  the right  of administration  to  the  religious
denomination  or   general  body   itself,  subject  to	 the
restrictions and  regulations as  the  law  might  chose  to
impose. In Shirur Mutt case (supra), this Court held at page
1029 that a law which takes away the right to administration
to the religious denomination altogether and vests it in any
other authority	 would amount  to a  violation of  the right
guaranteed under  clause (d)  of Article 26. So. A law would
not  totally   divest  the  administration  of	a  religious
institution or endowment, but the State has general right to
regulate the  right to	administration	of  a  religious  or
charitable institution	or endowment;  and such	 a  law	 may
chose to  impose such  restrictions whereof as are felt most
acute and provide a remedy therefor.



 In Ratilal	 Panachand Gandhi  vs. The State of Bombay &
Ors. [(1954)  S.C.R. 1055  at page 1063], this Court further
had pointed  out the distinction between clauses (b) and (d)
of Article 26 thus:  in regard	 to affairs  in	 matters  of
religion, the  right of management given to a religious body
is a  guaranteed fundamental  right which no legislation can
take away.  On the  other hand, as regards administration of
property which	a religious  denomination is entitled to own
and acquire, it has undoubtedly the right to administer such
property, but  only in	accordance with law. This means that
the  State   can  regulate   the  administration   of  trust
properties by  means of laws validly enacted; but here again
it should  be remembered that under Article 26(d), it is the
religious denomination	or general  body of  religion itself
which has been given the right to administer its property in
accordance with	 any law which the State may validly impose.
A  law,	  which	 takes	away  the  right  of  administration
altogether from	 the religious	denomination and vests it in
any other or secular authority, would amount to violation of
the right  which is  guaranteed	 by  Article 26(d)  of	 the
Constitution.  In  that	 case,	the  Court  found  that	 the
exercise of  the power	by the	Charity Commissioner  or the
Court to  divert the  trust property  or funds	for purposes
which he  or it considered expedient or proper, although the
original objects  of the  founder can  still be carried out,
was an	unwarranted encroachment on the freedom of religious
institutions in	 regard to the management of their religious
affairs.",

           In Civil Appeal No. 10620/2013, the  appellant  has  raised  the
      issue of  violation  of  the  constitutional  rights  protected  under
      Article 26 of the Constitution of India, 1950 (hereinafter referred to
      as ‘Constitution’) in  relation  to  the  claim  by  Podhu  Dikshitars
      (Smarthi Brahmins) to administer  the  properties  of  the  Temple  in
      question dedicated to Lord Natraja. The same gains further  importance
      as it also involves the genesis of such pre-existing rights even prior
      to the commencement of the Constitution and the extent of exercise  of
      State control under the  statutory  provisions  of  The  Madras  Hindu
      Religious and Charitable Endowments Act 1951 (hereinafter referred  to
      as the ‘Act 1951’) as well as  the  Tamil  Nadu  Hindu  Religious  and
      Charitable Endowments Act 1959 (hereinafter referred to  as  the  ‘Act
      1959’).

           On the other hand, Section 107 of the Act 1959 provides that the
      Act would not affect the rights guaranteed under  Article 26  of  the
      Constitution.  It reads:

                 “Nothing contained in this Act shall,  save  as  otherwise
           provided in Section 106 and in Clause (2) of Article 25  of  the
           Constitution, be deemed to confer any power or impose  any  duty
           in contravention  of  the  rights  conferred  on  any  religious
           denomination or  any  Section  thereof  by  Article 26  of  the
           Constitution.”

            Section 116 of the Act 1959 reads as under:



      9.    The aforesaid provisions make it clear that the  rights  of  the
      ‘denominational  religious  institutions’  are  to  be  preserved  and
      protected from any invasion by the State as guaranteed  under  Article
26 of the Constitution, and as statutorily embodied in Section 107  of
      the Act 1959.

      10.   Undoubtedly, the object and purpose of enacting  Article 26  of
      the Constitution is to protect  the  rights  conferred  therein  on  a
      `religious denomination` or a section  thereof.  However,  the  rights
      conferred under Article 26 are subject to public order,  morality  and
      health and not subject to any other  provision  of  Part  III  of  the
      Constitution as the limitation has been prescribed by the  law  makers
      by virtue of Article 25 of the Constitution.



 11.   The Constitution Bench of this Court in S. Azeez Basha & Anr. v.
      Union of India, AIR 1968 SC 662,  while dealing  with  the  rights  of
      minority to establish educational institutions, also  dealt  with  the
      provisions of Article 26 of the Constitution  and  observed  that  the
      words “establish and maintain” contained in Article 26  (a)  must  be
      read conjunctively.  A ‘religious  denomination’  can  only  claim  to
      maintain that institution which has been established by it.  The right
      to maintain  institutions  would  necessarily  include  the  right  to
      administer them.  The right under Article 26(a)  of  the  Constitution
      will only arise where the institution is established by  a  ‘religious
      denomination’ and only in that event, it can  claim  to  maintain  it.
      While dealing with the issue of Aligarh Muslim University, this  Court
      rejected the claim of Muslim community of the right to  administer  on
      the ground that it had not been established by  the  Muslim  community
      and, therefore, they did not have a right to maintain  the  university

the matter of religion guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the
Constitution or to administer the properties of the Temple in accordance
with law? In the Law Lexicon by P. Ramanatha Iyer (1987 Reprint Edition) at
page 315, the author says that ""denomina-tion"" means a class or collection
of individuals called by the same name; a sect; a class of units; a
distinctively named church or sect as clergy of all denominations. The
maxim Denominatio est a digniore means ""Denomination is from the more
worthy"" (Burrill). ""Denominate fieri debet a dignioribus"" another maxim
means ""denomination should be deduced from the more worthy"" (Wharton Law
Lexican). ""Denomine proprio non est curandum cum in substantia non erretur
quia nomina inutabilla sunt res autern immobiles meaning"" means ""as to the
proper name, it is not to be regarded when one errs not in substance;
because names are changeable, but things are immutable"". (Bouvier Law
Dictionary; Ame, Encyc.). in The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments,
Madras v, Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha  Swamiar  of Sri Shirur Math, [1954] SCR
1005, the precise meaning of the word ""denomination"" had come up for
consideration before the Constitution Bench. It was held, following the
meaning given in Oxford Dictionery, that the word 'denomination' means a
collection of in-dividuals or class together under the same name a
religious group or body having a common faith and organisation and
designated by a distinc-tive name. On the practices of the Math, the
meaning of the connotation 'denomination' in that behalf, it was held that
each such sect or special sects who founded by their organiser generally by
name be called a religious denomination as it is designated by distinctive
name in many cases. It is the name of the founder and has common faith and
common spiritual organisation: Article 26 contemplates not merely a
religious denomination but also a section thereof. Therefore, it was held
that Shimr Math was a religious denomination entitled to the protection of
Article 26. In The Durgah Committee, Ajmer & Anr. v. Syed  Hussain  Ali &
Ors. [1962] 1 SCR 383, another Constitution Bench considering the ratio
laid in Shirur Math's case explained Sri' Venkataramana Devaru's case
[1958] SCR 895 and had laid down that the words ""religious denomination""



under Article 26 of the Constitution must take their colour from the word
religion and if this be so the expression religious denomination must also
specify three conditions, namely it must be (1) a collection of religious
faith, a system of belief which is conducive to the spiritual well-being
i.e., a common faith; (2) common organisation; (3) a desig-nation by a
distinctive name. Therein, the endowment to the tomb of Hazrat Khwaja Moin-
ud-din Chishti of Ajmer, under the Khadims Dur-gah Khwaja Saheb Act, 1955
was challenged by the respondents as violative of their fundamental rights
under Articles 25, 26, 19(1)(f) and (g) of the Constitution. This Court had
held that Hazrat Moin-ud-din Chishti tomb was not confined to Muslims alone
but belonged to all communities, i.e., Hindus, Khwaja and Parsies Who visit
the tomb out of devotion for the memory of departed soul and it is a large
circle of pilgrims who must be held to be the beneficiary of the endowment
made to the tomb. Considered from that perspective, it was held that the
right to receive offerings was not affected or prejudiced by the Act,
though they had a right to worship in accordance with their faith. Article
26 requires to be carefully scrutinised to extend protection and it must be
confined to such religious practices as are an essential and integral part
of it and no other. The management of the properties was in the hands Of
the officers. Article 26 does not create rights in any denomination or a
section which it never had. It merely safeguards and guarantees the
Continuance of a right which such denomination or the section had. If the
denomination never had the right to manage property in favour of a
denominational institution as per reasonable terms on which the endowment
was created, it cannot be had to have it. It had not acquired the said
right as a result of Article 26 and that the practice and the custom
prevailing in that behalf which obviously is consistent which the terms of
the endowment should not be ignored. The Act cannot be treated as illegal
and the administration and management should be given to the denomina-tion.
Such a claim is inconsistent with Article 26. In Bramchari Sidheswar Shai &
Ors. v. State of West Bengal & Ors., [1995] 4 SCC 646, the relevant facts
were that the Ramakrishna Mission had established educational institutions
to which approval and affiliation were granted by the Govern-ment and the
University. The dispute arose as regards the composition of the Government
Body, viz., whether the Governments nominee would be associated on a
standard pattern? Ramakrishna Mission claimed ""minority"" status being a
denomination. In that perspective, this Court While rejected the claim of
the Mission as a minority institution under Article 30(1), upheld its
denominational character within the meaning of Article 26(a) of the
Constitution. It was held that it being a denomination was entitled to
administer the educational institutions. Therein, the vires of the statute
did not come up for consideration in the context of the followers of Sri
Ramakrishna who are professing the line of teachings and doctrines of Sri
Ramakrishna. The followers were considered, to be a denominational section
of the citizens. The ratio therein, therefore, does not apply to the facts
of the present ease.



The question, therefore relates to only administration of properties
belonging to the religious group or institution. They are not matters of
religion to which Article 25 or 26 gets attracted. Article 26 does not
protect the right to management and they are not entitled to the
management. In Bira Kishore Deb  v. State of  Orissa, AIR (1964) SC 1501,
another Constitu-tion Bench had held that Section 6 of Sri Jagannath Temple
Act, 1954 extinguishes the hereditary right of the Raja and entrusts
secular manage-ment of the Temple of Lord Jagannath at Puri to the
Committee of which he remains the Chairman. The superintendence of the
Temple is not the property. It carried no beneficial interest or enjoyment
of the property with it. The right was not acquired by the State. The whole
of the right to mange the Temple was extinguished and in its place another
body for the purpose of administration of the properties to the Temple was
created. In other words, the affairs of the functionary are brought to cm
end and another functionary had come into existence in its place. Such
process cannot be said to constitute the acquisition or extinguishment of
office or the vesting of the right in such persons holding that office
(emphasis supplied). In that context, it was contended that the Act
interfered with religious affairs of the Temple offending Article 19(1) of
the Constitution. The contention was rejected, The contention that it is a
denominational Temple was also not accepted. In S.P. Mittal v. Union of
India, AIR (1983) SC 1, the Constitution Bench was to consider whether
Auroville (Emergency Provisions) Act was viola-tive of Article 26 of the
Constitution. Considering the speeches and writings of Sri Aurobindo on
religious beliefs, it was held that it was not a religious denomination.
The Act was incidental to the proper administration. It was not violative
of Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.



The further contention of Sri Rajeev Dhavan is that the right of the
denomination to practise their faith and manage their affairs, as
guaranteed by Articles 26(b) and (d), has been eroded and they have been
deprived of it, The theft of jewellery of Lord Vishwanath is an offernce
and a law and order problem and cannot be made a rouse Or a cause to
interfere with religious rights and management of the religious properties.
Inter-ference in that behalf must be proportionate to the need, namely,
prevent-ing recurrence of thefts or mismanagement by appropriate action by
law-enforcing authorities. Even if there is any mismanagement of the
properties belonging to the Temple it should be corrected exercising the
power either under Section 92 CPC or under appropriate existing provision
in the U.P. Religious Endowments Act. It would, therefore, be clear that
the Act interferes with religious affairs and management of the properties
attached to the religious institution guaranteed by Articles 26(b) and (d).
He further contended that even if it is found to be necessary, the Act mast
be read down giving the appellant the right to manage religious affairs and
the administration of the properties, performance of the ceremonies by the
Pandas (Archakas, priests) so as to preserve the sanctity of the rights of
the worshippers which include, inter alia, the right to management of the
properties according to long standing usage or custom and to receive
offerings given by the pilgrims. Placement of the management of the
religious affairs and the properties in the hands of a few Hindus will not
satisfy the denominational right of the Hindus. He also contended that
Pandas are not just Shivaites but are like the trustees/Mahants. They are
Archakas as well. They perform pooja/cerermonies etc. which is integral to
the working of the Temple as a religious institution - a spiritual and
temploral fact of religion - and cannot be relegated to be a secular
activity. The Act deprives them of the share of the offerings received by
the Archakas without compensation. As Shivaites,,the Act interfere with
their legitimate right to function as Pandas in their denominational
character and also deprive them of their right to livelihood protected
Under Article 21 of the Constitution as it is integral to the management of
the Temple. We find no force in any of the contentions. It is already held
that practice of religious faith according to tenets of Hindu religion,
custom and usage stand protected by the Act. But the secular management of
the religious affairs in the Temple is secular part. The ""legislature has
power to interfere with and regulate proper and efficient management
thereof. This aspect of the question has been elaborately considered by a
three-Judge Bench to which two of Us (Ramaswamy and G.B. Pattanaik, JJ,)
were members in Bhuri Nath & Ors. v. State of Jammu & Kashmir & Ors., JT
(1997) 1 SC 546. Therein the controversy related"" to abolition of Bandars
rights to perform pooja and to own the properties and abolition thereof by
the Jammu and Kashmir Act of Mata Sri Vaishno Devi in Jammu. Since this
Court elaborately discussed the reasons in support of its holding, the need
to reiterate them once over is obviated.",

and   the   socioeconomic   structure	envisaged   by	 the
Constitution.  Thirdly, he sub.-nits that if under any law a
property is compulsorily acquired for public purpose and the
law  satisfies	the requirements of Article 31 A  the  Court
should	readily	 permit	 the  imposition  of  a	  reasonable
restriction on the exercise of the right to hold property in
the interest of the general public.
With  regard  to  the first objection  the  learned  counsel
submits	  that	the  Act  violates  Article 26(c)  of	 the
Constitution  which offers to every  religious	denomination
the  fundamental  right	 ""to own  and  acquire	movable	 and
immovable property"" subject only to ""public order,  morality
and  health"".	He  submits that the Act  aims	at  agrarian
reform but is not concerned with ""public order, morality and
health"".  Since it deprives religious denominations of their
ownership of property, it transgresses Article 26(c) and  is
invalid.  He also draws our attention to Article 25(1) which
has  subjected the rights therein not only to public  order,
morality  and health, but also to ""the other  provisions  of
Part III"".  Ho, therefore, submits that the right guaranteed
under Article 26(c) is Rot subject to ""the other pro visions
of Part III"" and therefore, there cart be no acquisition  of
property under Article 31 of the Constitution.
Articles 25 to 28 in Part III of the Constitution are placed
under  a sub-title ""Right to Freedom of Religion""  and	deal
with matters in the background of that freedom.	 It is	true
that  Article 25 is made subject to ""public order,  morality
and health"" and also ""to the other provisions of this  Part""



while Article 26 is only subject to ""public order,  morality
and health"".  Insertion of the expression ""the other  provi-
sions of this Part"" in Article 25 is understandable when  we
find  the particular rights which are taken care of in	this
Article, namely, the right to freedom of conscience and	 the
right  freely to profess, practice and	propagate  religion.
Bearing	 in  mind the overlapping nature  of  the  sensitive
rights, in Article 19(1) (a) with reference to citizens	 and
in Article 25(1) with reference to- all persons the founders
of  the	 Constitution left no room for	doubt  in  expressly
subjecting  Article  25(1) to the other provisions  of	Part
III.  Not only so sub-Article 2 of Article 25 provides	that
"".nothing in this Article shall affect the operation of	 any
existing  law  or  prevent the State  from  making  any	 law
regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political
or  other  secular  activity which may	be  associated	with
religious practice"".  The same considerations are,  however,
not exactly necessary while dealing with ""freedom to  manage
religious  affairs"" which is the rubric of Article 26.	  We
may now read Article 26 :



While Article 25, as stated earlier, confers the  particular
rights	on all persons, Article 26 is confined to  religious
denominations or any section thereof.  Article 19(1) confers
the  various  rights specified therein from (a)	 to  (g)  on
citizens.  A religious denomination or a section thereof  as
such is not a citizen.	In that sense the fields of the	 two
Articles  may  be to sonic extent  different.	Again  while
Article 26(c)	refers	to the right  ""to  own	and  acquire
movable	 and immovable property"", Article  19(1)(f)  confers
the  right  on	citizens ""to acquire, hold  and	 dispose  of
property"".  We are not required to consider in this case why
the  same expression is not used in the said two clauses  of
the  two  Articles.   One. thing  is,  however,	 clear	that
Article 26 guarantees intervals the right to own and acquire
movable	 and  immovable	 property  for	managing   religious
affairs.  This right, however, cannot take away the right of
the  State  to compulsorily acquire property  in  accordance
with  the  provisions of Article 31(2).	 If,  on  the  other
hand, acquisition of property of a religious denomination by
the  State  can-  be  proved to be such	 as  to	 destroy  or
completely negative its right to own and acquire movable and
immovable  property  for even the survival  of	a  religious
institution  the  question  may have to	 be  examined  in  a
different light.  That kind of a factual position,  however,
is  not	 taken in these appeals before us.   When,  however,
property is acquired by the State in accordance with law and
with  the  provisions of Article 31(2) and  the	 acquisition
cannot	be assailed on any valid ground open to	 the  person
concerned,  be it a religious institution, the right to	 own
that  property vanishes as that right is transferred to	 the
State.	Thereafter there is no question of any right to	 own
the  particular property subject to public  order,  morality
and health and Article 26 will in the circumstances be of no
relevance.   This  being  the legal position,  there  is  no
conflict between Article 26 and Article 31.
In   Khajamian	 Wakf  Estates'	 case  (at   page   797)   a
Constitutional	Bench  of this Court  dealing  with  Article
26(c) and (d) observed as follows :



	      (d) of article 26.""
We do not think that the above opinion of the Court in	that
case is of any assistance to the appellants.  The first	 and
the   second  submissions  of  the  learned   counsel	are,
therefore, of no avail.
When  we  look at the object of the Act and of	the  various
provisions  enacted in furtherance of agrarian	reform,	 the
Act  is	 squarely protected under the  saving  provision  of
Article 31A.  But it is then submitted that Article 31A does
not provide against the vice of contravention of Article 26
while  Articles	 14, 19 and 31 are  expressly  mentioned  in
Article	 3 1 A. The question, therefore, arises whether	 the
right  under  Article 26(c) is an absolute  and	 unqualified
right  to the extent that no agrarian reform can touch	upon
the lands owned by the religious de. nominations.  No rights
in an organised society can be absolute.  Enjoyment of one's
rights must be consistent with the enjoyment of rights	also
by others.  Where in a free play of social forces it is	 not
possible  to bring about a voluntary harmony, the State	 has
to  step  in to set right the  imbalance  between  competing
interests  and	there  the  Directive  Principles  of  State
Policy, although not enforceable in courts, have a  definite
and  positive role introducing an obligation upon the  State
under  Article 37 in making laws to regulate the conduct  of
men and their affairs.	In doing so, a distinction will have
to  be made between those laws which directly  infringe	 the
freedom	  of  religion	and  others,  although	 indirectly,
affecting some secular activities or religious	institutions
or  bodies.   For example if a	religious  institution	owns
large areas of land far exceeding the coiling under relevant
laws and indulges in activities detrimental to the  interest
of the agricultural

Now, the contention of Mr. K.V. Venkatasubramania Aiyar for the petitioners is that the position under the Indian Constitution is precisely the same as under the American Constitution and that the impugned Act is a law Sn respect of ""an establishment of religion"" and is therefore void. The provisions of the Constitution bearing on this question are Arts. 25, 26, 27 and 28. Article 25 enacts that  
  ""all  persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and propagate religion."" This provision corresponds to the second clause in the First Amendment and guarantees freedom of religion to all persons. Article 26 enacts that every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right to establish and maintain its own institutions and to manage them. This again is a guarantee of freedom of religion to religious groups as distinct from individuals for whom provision is made in Article 25. This also is an aspect which is comprised within the second clause of the First Amendment. Vide  'Watson v. Jones', (1873) 20 Law Ed 666 (J). Article 27 enacts that no person shall be compelled to pay taxes
""the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or  religious  denomination."" 



 It is difficult in the face of these provisions to accede to the contention that our Constitution has adopted the American view that the State should have nothing to do with religious institutions and endowments. It would, therefore, not be safe to build any argument based on the ""establishment of religion"" clause in the first Amendment and the decisions interpreting the same. 

 7. It is contended by Mr. K. V. Venkatasubramania Aiyar that though there is nothing express in the Constitution corresponding to the ""establishment of religion"" clause, such a provision must, in view of Article 282 read along with Article 27, be implied therein. Article 282 runs as follows: ""The Union or a State may make any grants
for any public  purpose, notwithstanding that
the purpose is not one with respect to which

Parliament or the Legislature of the State, as the case may be, may make laws."" Though this Article is enabling, in that it empowers the legislature to make grants in respect of matters which are not within their legislative competence, it is restrictive in that grants can be made only for a public purpose. The Article does not in terms prohibit any grant for meeting expenses of administering religious endowments. But it is contended that religion is, under the Constitution, not a public purpose and that, therefore, a grant for purposes mentioned in Section 76 (4) of the Act would be in violation of Article 282.



The argument in support of the position that religion is not a public purpose may be thus summed up; Article 27 prohibits the raising of revenue by taxation for being appropriated towards"" the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination.' ""That means that religion is not a public purpose and that is in accordance with the American law on the subject. Article 282 is complementary to Article 27. It prohibits the expenditure of public revenue on what are not public purposes. Therefore, public funds cannot under Article 282 be appropriated towards the expenses mentioned in Article 76 (4) of the Act. The result is that the machinery set up under that Act for the administration of the religious endowments cannot function and the whole Act must be declared void. 



 But, as already mentioned, while the Indian Constitution has adopted in Article 27 and Article 28(1) some of the results consequential on the application of establishment of religion clause in the First Amendment, it has studiedly refrained from accepting that clause itself as a fundamental principle for all purposes. And in view of the fact that the reasoning on which the American decisions hold that the establishment of religion is not a public purpose, namely, that it is linked up in the First Amendment with free exercise of religion which is not a public purpose, is not applicable under the Indian Constitution, it follows that the conclusion based on the reasoning is equally inapplicable.",
Article 27,"Surksh Chandra Chiman Lal Shah vs Union Of India And Ors. on 14 February, 1975",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/631213/?formInput=Article%2027,,"(1) Is India a secular State ? If so, in what sense ? These questions arc raised by this writ petition filed by a Hindu and the connected writ petitions Nos. 1225 of 1973. 235 of 1974 and 919 of 1974 filed by some Jains to challenge the legality of the programme of the celebration of the 2500th Anniversary of Bhagwan Mahavir's Nirvan (Salvation) extending over a period of one year from November 13, 1974 onwards by the Government of India.  

 (2) The programme for the celebration drawn up by a National Advisory Committee consisting mainly of prominent members of the Jain Community and approved by the Government involving an expenditure of about rupees fifty lakhs by the Government includes the following:-Development of a national park named after Bhagwan Mahavir, Erection of stone pillars therein with inscriptions from his sayings, episodic treatment of his life by sculptors; Establishment of a museum of Jain art and paintings, a library of Jain literature; Setting up of a National Council of Jainological studies; Setting up of twenty Bhagwan Mahavir Bal Kendras in which apart from recreation etc., arrangements for imparting knowledge about the life and teachings of Bhagwan Mahavir to children would be made; Establishment of rural library centres named after Bhagwan Mahavir in each State; monument at the birth place of Bhagwan Mahavir at Vaishali consisting of a concealed water tank; Organising of Bhagwan Mahavir Memorial Lectures and institution visiting fellowships and scholarships, arranging seminars, organising joint meetings of the heads of research centres and institutions of Jain learnings; Publication of books on life and teachings of Bhagwan Mahavir; releasing of a postal stamp on November 13, 1974; showing documentary films on Jain art, architecture, paintings and places of pilgrimage; Exhibitions of Jain art, literature, paintings, culture and manuscripts; Declaring November 13. 1974 a Dry and closure of slaughter houses and sale of meat inpublic eating houses, etc.  

 (3) While all the petitioners ostensibly take the stand that India is a secular State and that the impugned programme is contrary to the secular nature of the State, there is a basic difference in the approach of the Hindu petitioner and the Jain petitioners. Understandably, the Hindu petitioner complains that the State is virtually promoting and maintaining Jain religion in particular and in preference to other religions by the implementation of the impugned programme and, therefore, the expenditure on it from the public funds is contrary to the prohibition contained in Article 27 of the Constitution. He further says that his Art. 27 :-Freedom as to payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion.-No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religion denomination. own fundamental right to profess and practise Hinduism guaranteed by Article 25 is violated by it. There is some plausibility about nonJains feeling discriminated against by this State patronage of the celebration of an event which the non-Jains are likely to regard as giving a greater importance to the Jains than to the others.  



 (16) Before any of the petitioners can complain of the infringement of the fundamental right guaranteed by Article 27, he has to show that public funds were spent on the promotion or maintenance of the Jain religion in particular in preference to other religions. The last words of the Article ""for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination"" are significant. The impugned programme cannot be said to promote or maintain Jain religion. The expression ""religious instruction"" was narrowly construed by the Supreme Court in the D.A.V- College's case, referred to above, to mean ""that which is imparted for inculcating the tenets, the rituals, the observances ceremonies and modes of worship of a particular Sect or denomination"". The trend of the Supreme Court decisions is to confine religion to the essential doctrine and the necessary ceremonies associated with it and not to extend it to secular or cultural activities. The impugned programme cannot, therefore, be said to promote or maintain the Jain religion- If the provision of facilities for the study of and research in Sikh religion did not amount to religious instruction, then the facilities for disseminating knowledge of Jainism and providing for the study of it will not amount to promotion or maintenance of Jainism. Further, the cultural activity sponsored by the Government of India is a part of a long-range continuous policy not restricted to Jainism. As pointed out by Justice Gajendragadkar("") a perusal of Article 27 makes it at once clear that unlike the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States, what this article prohibits is the payment of taxes for promotion of any particular religion- Under the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States the Congress cannot make appropriations in aid of religious bodies at all,. but under Article 27 of our Constitution what is prohibited is payment of taxes for any particular religion and not for the promotion of all religions generally. This article thus brings out the fact that the secularism contemplated by the Indian Constitution is not anti-god or anti-religion. In the Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swmniar of Sri Shirur Mutt, (1954) Scr 1005 at 1045, the Supreme Court had to consider the levy of a tax the proceeds of which were to be spent on the administration of religious trusts and institutions. Its constitutionality was challenged under Article 27. But the Court repelled the challenge in the following words:-    ""BUT the object of the contribution under section 76 of the Madras Act is not the fostering or preservation of the Hindu religion or any denomination within it. The pur- pose is to see that religious trusts and institutions, where- over they exist, are properly administered......... There is no question of favoring ""any particular religion or religious denomination in such cases.""



 In Mahant Sri Jagannath Ramanuj Das v. The State of Orissa, (1954) S.C.R. 1046 at 1054-55(""), the Supreme Court again considered the meaning of Article 27 in the following words :-   ""WE are further of opinion that an imposition like this can- not be said to be hit by article 27 of the Constitution. What is forbidden by article 27 is the specific appropria- tion of the proceeds of any tax in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. The object of the contribution under section 49 is not the fostering or preservation of the Hindu religion or of any denomi- nation within it, the purpose is to see that religious trusts ""Secularism and the Constitution of India"", and institutions wherever they exist are properly administered......... As there is no question of favoring any particular religion or religious denomination, article 27 could not possibly apply.""



 These decisions would show that it is only the favoring, of one particular religion as against others which is prohibited by article 27. The petitioners do not deny the statement of the Government on affidavit that the Government has been consistently honouring the memory of the great sons of India for the past some time impartially and irrespective of the religions to which they belonged. It cannot be said, therefore, that the Government is promoting or maintaining only the Jain religion at the expense of other religions. There is, therefore, no infringement of Article 27 of the Constitution in this case at all.",
Article 27,"Prafull Goradia vs Union Of India on 28 January, 2011",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/709044/?formInput=Article%2027,,"The petitioner contends that his fundamental right under Article 27 of the

Constitution is being violated. We have, therefore, to correctly understand

and interpret Article 27.


 There are not many decisions which have given an indepth

interpretation of Article 27.     The decision in Commissioner, Hindu

Religious Endowments vs. Sri Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar, 1954 (5)

SCR 1005 held (vide page 1045) that since the object of the Madras Hindu



Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1951 is not to foster or preserve

the Hindu religion but to see that religious trusts and institutions are properly

administered, Article 27 is not attracted. The same view was taken in

Jagannath Ramanuj Das vs. State of Orissa and Anr. 1954(5) SCR

1046. The decision in T.M.A. Pae Foundation vs. State of Karnataka,

AIR 2003 SC 355 (vide paragraph 85) does not really deal with Article 27 at

any depth.




       There can be two views about Article 27. One view can be that

Article 27 is attracted only when the statute by which the tax is levied

specifically states that the proceeds of the tax will be utilized for a particular

religion. The other view can be that Article 27 will be attracted even when

the statute is a general statute, like the Income Tax Act or the Central Excise

Act or the State Sales Tax Acts (which do not specify for what purpose the

proceeds will be utilized) provided that a substantial part of such proceeds

are in fact utilized for a particular religion.




 In our opinion Article 27 will be attracted in both these eventualities.

This is because Article 27 is a provision in the Constitution, and not an

ordinary statute. Principles of interpreting the Constitution are to some

extent different from those of interpreting an ordinary statute vide judgment



of Hon'ble Sikri, J. in Kesavanand Bharati vs. State of Kerala, 1973 (4)

SCC 225 (vide para 15). The object of Article 27 is to maintain secularism,

and hence we must construe it from that angle.



                          (ii) That a part of the taxes so collected have
                    been utilized for various purposes including
                    promotion and maintenance of a particular religion
                    and religious institutions.""

       Thus, it is nowhere mentioned in the Writ Petition as to what

percentage of any particular tax has been utilized for the purpose of the Haj

pilgrimage. The allegation in para 5(ii) of the Writ Petition is very vague.



       In our opinion, if only a relatively small part of any tax collected is

utilized for providing some conveniences or facilities or concessions to any



religious denomination, that would not be violative of Article 27 of the

Constitution. It is only when a substantial part of the tax is utilized for any

particular religion that Article 27 would be violated.",
Article 27,"The State Of Maharashtra, Through ... vs Mr. Rahul Alias Raosaheb Dashrath ... on 17 October, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/491454/?formInput=Article%2027,,"32. Coming to the weapon of assault (Suri Article 27), the same was recovered under Panchanama Exhibits 70 and 71 under Section 27 of the Evidence Act. The Article was removed by the Accused from underneath a big stone in front of Wadia Farm on the Pune - Nagar Road. It is the contention of the Defence that the discovery of the weapon from an open place which is accessible to all is not admissible in evidence and has supported his contention by relying upon the judgment of Abdul Sattar v. Union Territory, Chandigarh, . However, the mere fact that the knife (Article 27) was recovered from a road does not destroy the evidential value of the recovery as the knife was hidden underneath a stone. This fact was known only to the Accused and no one else and, therefore, the recovery of the knife (Article 27) at the instance of the Accused cannot be said to be from the open place although it is accessible to all since no one else had the knowledge of the knife hidden beneath the stone. This is made abundantly clear by the Supreme Court in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh v. Jeet Singh (1999 ALL M.R.CR. 806 (Supreme Court)  Furthermore, it cannot be said that there was any delay in the discovery of the weapon as the same was done within two days from the date of arrest of the Accused who was arrested on 27.11.1999. The discovery was made on 29.11.1999.



33. The Defence has also challenged the Prosecution case that the Accused cut the throat of Guddu with the knife (Article 27) by relying on a certain cut marks in the medical evidence pertaining to the injuries which he contends are inconsistent with the nature of the weapon (Article 27) allegedly used for cutting the throat of the victim girl. It is pointed out by the learned Advocate for the Defence that Dr. Prashant Patil (P.W. 17) was admitted in paragraph (14) of his evidence that it is correct that when the margin of injuries are clean cut, then the weapon by which injuries are caused must have sharp edge. If edge of weapon is not sharp, then the margin of injury are irregular. Dr. Patil has admitted that injury No. 4 in column 17, i.e., cut throat injury is clean cut injury. It is further pointed out that P.W. 17 has stated on seeing the article 27 that the central portion of the knife is sharp but irregular; whereas the forward portion of the weapon is sharp and it is correct that the tip of the Article 27 is not sharp. Placing reliance on the description of the knife, it is the contention of the Defence that injury No. 4 which is clean cut sharp injury could not have been caused by the knife Article 27. However, it must be pointed out that P.W. 17 is an expert witness and in his examination in chief he has clearly stated that injury No. 4, i.e., cut throat injury is possible by the weapon Article 27 which is produced before the Court. In the face of this clear cut opinion given by Dr. Prashant Patil (P.W.17), there is no scope left for the defence to point out that the injuries were not possible with the knife Article 27. Even if the knife had irregular edges, much will depend on how the knife was used while cutting the throat. There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of Dr. Prashant Patil (P.W. 17).



36. The panchanama of the seizure of the bicycle is also challenged on the ground of discrepancies in the time of the memorandum and the time of starting the seizure panchanama. It is pointed out that the place from where the bicycle was seized under Panchanama (Exhibit 74) is at a considerable distance from the Police Station where the memorandum of panchanama (Exhibit 73) was prepared. Exhibit 73 indicates that it was complected on 4.12.1999 at 3-45 P.M.; whereas the seizure panchanama also shows that it started at 3-45 P.M. There is an obvious error on the part of the Police in recording the timing, but this by itself does not destroy the evidential value of the recovery unless it can be shown that the Panchas were not truthful and there some reason to disbelieve the Panchas. Thus, except for some minor discrepancies in the timing and other trivial circumstances, it cannot be said that the recovery of the incriminating articles from the house of the Accused under the seizure panchanama (Exhibit-61) and of the knife (Article 27) from underneath a stone near  ""Khusboo Nursery"" under the seizure panchanama (Exhibit-71) and the bicycle from the house of the sister of the Accused under the panchanama (Exhibit-74) cannot be accepted. These recoveries substantiate the Prosecution story that the offence was committed by the Accused in his house after which he took the body in a gunny sack on his bicycle and dumped it at a spot far from his house and that murder of the deceased girl was committed by him by the knife (Article 27). The said recoveries, in fact, go to prove the Prosecution case beyond doubt.



44. The medical evidence produced by the Prosecution to connect the Accused with the rape and ravishment of the victim girl Guddu is further corroborated by the Chemical Analyser's Report (Exhibit 20) which shows the blood group of the deceased Guddu as that of ""AB"" group. Further the Chemical Analyser's Report (Exhibit 17) shows that blood stains of blood group ""AB"" of the said deceased Guddu were found on the Articles at serial Nos. 14 to 17, i.e., shirt, full pant, banian and underwear of the Accused. In addition to the blood stains of ""AB"" group on the nicker (Article 13). which is at serial No. 13 in the C.A. report (Exhibit 17), antigens of ""A"", ""B"" and ""O"" group in the blood and semen stains were detected. Blood stains of ""AB"" group were also found on the Articles, i.e., mattress, curtain and polythene paper which are shown at serial Nos. 19, 21 and 22 of the Chemical Analyser's Report (Exhibit 17). These Articles were seized from the house of the Accused Rahul under the seizure panchanama Exhibit 61, but no explanation is given by the Accused in his statement under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 as to how these articles came to be stained with blood and that too of the blood group ""AB"". It is further established that the polythene (plastics) paper (Article 4) in which the dead body was found wrapped and recovered under panchanama (Exhibit 42) and the piece of polythene paper (Article 22) found in the house of the Accused and recovered under Panchanama Exhibit 61 are identical and both were having blood stains of ""AB"" group as can be seen from the Chemical Analyser's Report (Exhibit 17). Furthermore, the knife (Article 27), the alleged weapon of assault, and the bicycle carrier (Article 24) shown in the Chemical Analyser's Report (Exhibit 17) were also found with the blood-stains of ""AB"" group.",
Article 27,"Dr.Surbahmaniam Swamy vs State Of Kerala on 27 January, 2011",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1816970/?formInput=Article%2027,,"48. In T.M.A.Pai Foundation and others v. State of

the Constitution, per Kirpal, C.J. observed at                                    paragraph 85 as

follows:

Such an observation came to be made in the context of the question

whether a minority educational institution which received financial

aid from the State can prefer candidates of their own community in

the matter of admission to the various courses and whether State's

financial aid to such an institution which insists upon the

maintenance for preference is violative of Article 27 of the

Constitution of India.

             49. The scope of Article 27 vis-a-vis the utilization of

State's funds fell for consideration of the various courts in the

following cases. In Surksh Chandra Chiman Lal Shah v. Union of

India and others (ILR 1975 Delhi 32) a Division Bench of the Delhi

High Court considered the legality of a programme of the Union of

India involving an expenditure of about Rupees fifty lakhs in

              ""Petitioner has raised the contention that national resources

     are being utilised for betterment of a particular religion which is

     impermissible in law. Law is well settled that a State is prohibited to

     patronage any particular religion. Ours is a Secular nation and it has

     no religion of its own and no particular religion can receive any

     special patronage from the State.      State's endeavour to improve

     health, family welfare, safety recreation and general well-being of the

     citizens of the minority community may indirectly impose burden on

     the State exchequer, but it cannot be said that those actions of the

     State would amount to patronizing any particular religion. Article 27

     of the Constitution states that no person shall be compelled to pay

     any taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated in

     payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any

     particular religion or religious denomination. Funds utilised by the

     States for improving the basic amenities, providing infrastructure

     facilities to minority concentrated     areas, improvement of their

     providing education, etc. would not violate Article 27 of the

     Constitution. Funds are not utilised for inculcating any religion or

     advancement of any particular religion affecting the constitutional

     requirement of neutrality.""



             52. The decisions demonstrate that the courts examined

the dominant purpose behind the State action in deciding whether

the State action is in violation of Article 27. The principle that

emerges from the above decisions is that the spending of money by

the State on an activity which has a basis in some religion does not

by itself attract the prohibition contained in Article 27. If that were to

be so, all the policies of the State which provide subsidization of the

food to poor people would also attract the prohibition contained in

Article 27 as such a practice not only coincides but also is rooted in

religious belief common to all major religions that feeding the poor is

a meritorious activity. In our opinion to attract the prohibition of

Article 27 the State action must have the effect of intentionally and

directly promoting or maintaining any particular religion.                      To

ascertain the same the purpose behind the expenditure and the

primary result of such an activity are required to be examined.",

money for repair/restructuring/construction of any ‘religious

Constitution. On a true, meaningful and purposive construc-

tion of Article 27, no writ, order or direction can be issued

having the direct or indirect effect of use of State funds for

repair/ restructuring/ construction of any religious places.

The term “of any particular religion” or “religious denomina-

tion” as used in Article 27 needs to be given wider interpreta-

tion so as to protect, preserve and give effect to the spirit of

Article 27. On a purposeful interpretation of Article 27, it be-

comes apparent that the funds of the State cannot be di-

rected to be used for ‘maintenance’ [which includes repair/

restructuring/ construction] of any religion (which essentially

includes religious places) or may be all the religions whether

individually or simultaneously. If such an interpretation is

not given, there can be situation where a State can declare a

portion of State fund to be used for maintenance of places of

spirit and object of Article 27 in particular and that of Arti-

cles 25, 26, 27 and 28 in general. On a meaningful and pur-

posive construction of Article 27, even in such a case when

the State fund is directed by the High Court by way of a writ

for ‘maintenance’ of all religions [which term would necessar-

ily include repair/ restructuring/ construction of ‘places of

worship’], it would still be offending the secular fabric of the

Constitution and it would be violative of Article 27 in particu-

lar. In this regard, our attention has been invited to Arch R.

Everson v. Board of Education of the Township of Ew-

ing6.



32. Article 27 of the Constitution reads as follows:
    “Article 27.──Freedom as to payment of taxes for

33. In The Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments,

Madras (supra), the Court, while commenting on Article 27,

held thus:



34. In Prafull Goradia v. Union of India28, the Court,

while interpreting Article 27, referred to the decisions in The

Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras

(supra), Sri Jagannath Ramanuj Das and another v.

State of Orissa and another29 and also alluded to T.M.A.

Pai Foundation and others v. State of Karnataka and

others30 and opined that the said decisions did not really

deal with Article 27 at any depth. Elaborating further, the

two-Judge Bench held:

     “6. There can be two views about Article 27. One
     view can be that Article 27 is attracted only when
     the statute by which the tax is levied specifically
28    (2011) 2 SCC 568
29    AIR 1954 SC 400
30    (2002) 8 SCC 481


     states that the proceeds of the tax will be utilised
     for a particular religion. The other view can be
     that Article 27 will be attracted even when the
     statute is a general statute, like the Income Tax
     Act or the Central Excise Act or the State Sales
     Tax Acts (which do not specify for what purpose
     the proceeds will be utilised) provided that a sub-



 stantial part of such proceeds are in fact utilised
     for a particular religion. In our opinion Article 27
     will be attracted in both these eventualities. This
     is because Article 27 is a provision in the Consti-
     tution, and not an ordinary statute. The princi-
     ples of interpreting the Constitution are to some
     extent different from those of interpreting an or-
     dinary statute vide the judgment of Hon’ble Sikri,
     J. in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala31
     (vide SCC para 15). The object of Article 27 is to
     maintain secularism, and hence we must con-
     strue it from that angle.",

3. Learned senior counsels appearing for the petitioners took us through the various covenants/clauses in ""TRIPS"" to argue that the amended section, as it stands today, runs contra to the various articles found incorporated in ""TRIPS"". The main thrust is with reference to Article 27 of ""TRIPS"". It is contended that Article 1(1) of the ""TRIPS"" mandates every Page 1273 member country to give effect to the provisions of the ""TRIPS"" and India being a member country, in implementing the various provisions of ""TRIPS"" brought in the amended section violating their obligations under ""TRIPS"". It is argued by learned senior counsels that the proposed amendment brought in under the Ordinance is compatible to ""TRIPS"". However, without any rhyme or reason, the proposed amendment sought to be introduced by the Ordinance had been completely given up and instead, the offending amended section was brought. The sum and substance of the argument advanced by learned senior counsels for the petitioner company is, by bringing in the amended section and the Explanation attached to it, the Union of India had infact not carried out it's obligations arising out of ""TRIPS"" and instead, by the amended section making that the discovery of a new form of a known substance, which does not result in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance as not patentable, the right to have an invention patented guaranteed under Section 27 of the ""TRIPS"" is taken away. As far as the attack to the section on the ground of arbitrariness and vagueness thereby offending Article 14 of the Constitution of India, it is argued by Mr. Soli Sorabji, learned senior counsel, that the amended section as it stands today is unworkable. Section 3 of the Act enumerates what are not inventions. Under Article 27 of ""TRIPS"", all inventions, subject to paragraphs 2 and 3 of that Article, are patentable. Reading Article 27 as a whole, it is argued that the drug invented in the case on hand is patentable. Under the amended section, the patent applicant is required to show that the invention has enhanced efficacy of the known substance. Though the efficacy of a known substance may be well known, yet, unless there are some guidelines in the amended section itself to understand the expression ""enhancement of the known efficacy"" namely, what would be treated as ""enhanced efficacy"", an uncontrolled discretion is given to the Patent Controller to apply his own standards, which may not be uniform, in deciding whether there is enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance. Such wide discretion vested with a Statutory Authority without any guidelines to follow, would result in arbitrary exercise of power. In other words, the Patent Controller may be in a position to decide any case, based on his whims and fancies namely, whether there is enhancement in the known efficacy or not. On this short ground, the section must be held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Likewise, in the Explanation attached to the amended section also, there is vagueness. The Explanation declares that all derivatives of a known substance shall be considered to be the same substance unless they ""differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy"". Derivatives need not be the same substance in all cases. Unless the Explanation contains guidelines as to when a derivative can be held to differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy, the Patent Controller will have an unguided power to decide the issue, which once again would result in arbitrariness. It is argued by learned senior counsels that though efficacy of a known substance could be clinically found, any discovery of a new form of the said substance or it's derivatives, though by themselves are inventions as defined in the Act, are denied patent based Page 1274 on the amended section containing specified offending clauses namely, it should show enhancement of the known efficacy and that the derivatives should differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy.



5. On the submissions made by the learned senior counsels on either side, we are of the considered opinion that the following issues arise for consideration in these two writ petitions:

(a) Assuming that the amended section is in clear breach of Article 27 of ""TRIPS"" and thereby suffers the wise of irrationality and arbitrariness violating Article 14 of the Constitution of India, could the courts in India have jurisdiction to test the validity of the amended section in the back drop of such alleged violation of ""TRIPS""? OR
 

Even if the amended section cannot be struck down by this Court for the reasons stated above, cannot this Court grant a declaratory relief that the amended section is not in compliance of Article 27 of ""TRIPS""?.



(b) If it is held that courts in India have jurisdiction to go into the above referred to issue, then, is the amended section compatible or non-compatible to Article 27 of ""TRIPS""?

(c) Dehors issues (a) and (b) referred to above, could the amended section be held to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India on the ground of vagueness, arbitrariness and conferring un-canalised powers on the Statutory Authority?

6. Let us take the first issue.

(a) Assuming that the amended section is in clear breach of Article 27 of ""TRIPS"" and thereby suffers the vice of irrationality and arbitrariness violating Article 14 of the Constitution of India, could the courts in India have jurisdiction to test the validity of the amended section in Page 1276 the back drop of such alleged violation of ""TRIPS"" (OR) Even if the amended section cannot be struck down by this Court for the reasons stated above, cannot this Court grant a declaratory relief that the amended section is not in compliance of Article 27 of ""TRIPS""?: In support of the arguments that Indian courts have jurisdiction to decide the issue under consideration, learned senior counsels appearing for the petitioners relied upon the decision of the House of Lords in the case reported in Equal Opportunities Commission and Anr. v. Secretary of State for Employment (1994) 1 AII ER Pg.910. Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act, 1978 was under consideration in that judgment in the context of discrimination against women alleged. Under that Act, full-time workers, who worked for 16 or more hours a week had to be in continuous employment for two years to qualify for Statutory rights under the Act whereas, part-time workers, who worked between 8 and 16 hours in a week had to be in continuous employment for five years to qualify for the Statutory rights under that Act. That judgment noted that a great majority of full-time employers in the United Kingdom were men while the great majority of part-time workers were women. Equal Opportunities Commission took the view that such discrimination conflicted with the obligations of the United Kingdom under EEC Law namely, Article 119 of EEC Treaty and Council Directives 75/117 (the Equal Pay Directive) and 76/207 (the Equal Treatment Directive). The Secretary of the State declined to accept that the United Kingdom was in breach of it's obligations under Community Law while providing less favourable treatment in the conditions of employment of full-time workers and part-time workers. Therefore, the Equal Opportunities Commission applied for judicial review of the Secretary of State's decision and sought a declaration that the Secretary of State and United Kingdom were in breach of Community Law obligations and an order of mandamus requiring the Secretary of State to introduce Legislation to provide the right for men and women to receive equal pay for equal work. Further reliefs were also asked for. The Secretary of State raised two objections namely, the claim of an individual applicant is a private law claim, which ought not to have been brought against the Secretary of State by way of judicial review and that the Commission had no locus standi to bring the proceedings as it 's case did not involve any decision on justiciable issue susceptible of judicial review. It was further contended by the Secretary of State that the court had no jurisdiction to declare that United Kingdom or the Secretary of State was in breach of any obligations under the Community Law and that the Divisional Court was not the appropriate forum to determine the substantive issue raised by the applicant. The Divisional Court, among other things, held that the court only had jurisdiction to declare rights and obligations enforceable under the existing state of the Law and had no jurisdiction to order mandamus requiring the Secretary of State to introduce Legislation to amend the 1978 Act or to declare that he was Page 1277 under a duty to do so. The Commission as well as the individual applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the individual applicant's appeal on the ground that her application was essentially a private law claim, which should have been brought against her employer in an Industrial Tribunal and dismissed the Commission's appeal on the ground that the Secretary of State had not made any ""decision"". The Court of Appeal also held that there was no justiciable issue suitable for consideration by way of judicial review. The Commission and the individual appealed to the House of Lords. The House of Lords raised various questions to be addressed by it in that appeal and in our respectful opinion, the decision of the House of Lords on one of the questions raised by it to be addressed, would be relevant for the purpose of the case on hand. We extract that question hereunder:



7. Learned Counsels, in particular, Mr. Anand Grover and Mr. Lakshmikumaran, argued with tremendous ease - as they are shown to possess - stating that the judgment referred to above and relied upon by the learned senior counsels could not be applied to the case on hand on facts. By taking us through the very same judgment, it is argued by them that under Section 2(1) of the European Communities Act, 1972, Article 119 of the EEC Treaty with the two Council Directives referred to earlier have been domesticated as a domestic Law in England. When the relevant provision of the EEC Treaty and the Councils Directives stand domesticated by an Act of the State, then it becomes Law of that State enforceable in letter and spirit by the citizens of that State. It is their argument that ""TRIPS"" do not become Law in India on it's own force without any domestic Law legislated by the Indian Government. Only in discharging their obligations under ""TRIPS"", several amendments, including the amended section, were brought into the Statute book namely, Patents Act, by the Government. Therefore they argued that when Equal Opportunities Commission case can be distinguished on facts, it would be inappropriate to rely upon the same to hold that a declaratory relief can be granted by this Court. As the learned Counsels were making their submissions on the above point, Mr. Shanthi Bhushan, learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioner in one of the writ petitions, very fairly conceded and stated that Equal Opportunities Commission's case can be distinguished on facts. We do find, on going through the judgment in Equal Opportunities Commission's case, that the provisions of EEC Treaty and the Councils Directives by an Act of the State was domesticated and therefore all the rights flowing out of the said Treaty and the Directives were available as Law in the United Kingdom, which can be enforceable. Only in that context, we state with respect that the House of Lords has given a declaration as prayed for. Learned Counsels appearing for the contesting parties did not rest with the laurel of making us accept and Mr. Shanthi Bhushan to concede that Equal Opportunities Commission case is distinguishable on facts but spared no efforts in advancing arguments in their own way, supported by case laws, that Indian Courts have no jurisdiction either to test the validity of a State Act as being incompatible to an International Treaty namely, Article 27 or even to give a declaration simplicitor that such State Act is not compatible to an International Treaty. We will be failing in our duty if we do not mention that Mr. V.T. Gopalan, learned Additional Solicitor General was leading from the forefront the entire band of lawyers in the opposite camp by contending that this Court has no jurisdiction at all to go into the issue referred to above; in any event the amended section is in compliance with Article 27 of ""TRIPS"" and that there is no violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. Mr. Lakshmikumaran, learned Counsel appearing for R5 and R7 relied Page 1279 upon a judgment reported in 1966-3-All England Law Reports Pg.871 (Salomn v. Commissioner of Customs) to contend that if any domestic court is approached challenging a municipal law on the ground that it violates International Law, then, the remedy for that lies in a forum other than the domestic court. In that judgment, the Court of Appeal through LORD DIPLOCK held as hereunder:",
Article 28,"T.M.A.Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/512761/?formInput=Article%2028,,"86. Article 28(1) prohibits any educational institution, which is wholly
maintained out of state funds, to provide for religious instruction. Moral
education dissociation from any demoninational doctrine is not prohibited;
but, as the state is intended to be secular, an educational institution
wholly maintained out of state funds cannot impart or provide for any
religious instruction.

87. The exception to Article 28(1) is contained in Article 28(2). Article
28(2) deals with cases where, by an endowment or trust, an institution is
established, and the terms of the endowment or the trust require the
imparting of religious instruction, and where that institution is
administered by the state. In such a case, the prohibition contained in
Article 28(1) does not apply. If the administration of such an institution
is voluntarily given to the government, or the government, for a good
reason and in accordance with law, assumes or takes over the management of
that institution, say on account of mal-administration, then the
government, on assuming the administration of the institution, would be
obliged to continue with the imparting of religious instruction as provided
by the endowment or the trust.



88. While Article 28(1) and Article 28(2) relate to institutions that are
wholly maintained out of state funds, Article 28(3) deals with an
educational institution that is recognized by the state or receives aid out
of state funds. Article 28(3) gives the person attending any educational
institution the right not to take part in any religious instruction, which
may be imparted by an institution recognized by the state, or receiving aid
from the state. Such a person also has the right not to attend any
religious worship that may be conducted in such an institution, or in any
premises attached thereto, unless such a person, or if he/she is a minor,
his/her guardian, has given his/her consent. The reading of Article 28(3)
clearly shows that no person attending an educational institution can be
required to take part in any religious instruction or any religious
worship, unless the person or his/her guardian has given his/her consent
thereto, in a case where the educational institution has been recognized by
the state or receives aid out of its funds. We have seen that Article 26(a)
gives the religious denomination the right to establish an educational
institution, the religious denomination being either of the majority
community or minority community. In any institution, whether established by
the majority or a minority religion, if religious instruction in imparted,
no student can be compelled to take part in the said religious instruction
or in any religious worship. An individual has the absolute right not to be
compelled to take part in any religious instruction or worship. Article
28(3) thereby recognizes the right of an individual to practice or profess
his own religion. In other words, in matters relating to religious
instruction or worship, there can be no compulsion where the educational
institution is either recognized by the state or receives aid from the
state.



100. With reference to Article 29(2), the Court observed at page 1055,
while dealing with an argument based on Article 337 that ""likewise Article
29(2) provides, inter alia, that no citizen shall be denied admission into
any educational institution receiving did out of State funds on grounds
only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them"". Referring to Part
III of the Constitution and to Articles 19 and 25 to 28 in particular, the
Court said:-
"".....Under Article 25 all persons are equally entitled, subject to public
order, morality and health and to the other provisions of Part III, to
freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise and
propagate religion. Article 26 confers the fundamental right to every
religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order,
morality and health, to establish and maintain institutions for religious
and charitable purposes, to manage its own affairs in matters of religion,
to acquire property and to administer such property in accordance with law.
The ideal being to constitute India into a secular State, no religious
instruction is, under Article 28(1), to be provided in any educational
institution wholly maintained out of State funds and under Clause (3) of
the same Article no person attending any educational institution recognized
by the State or receiving aid out of State funds is to be required to take
part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution
or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such
institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if
such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto. Article
29(1) confers on any section of the citizens having a distinct language,
script or culture of its own to have the right of conserving the same.
Clause (2) of that Article provides that no citizen shall be denied
admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or
receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste,
language or any of them.""



144. It cannot be argued that no conditions can be imposed while giving aid
to a minority institution. Whether it is an institution run by the majority
or the minority, all conditions that have relevance to the proper
utilization of the grant-in-aid by an educational institution can be
imposed. All that Article 30(2) states is that on the ground that an
institution is under the management of a minority, whether based on
religion or language, grant of aid to that educational institution cannot
be discriminated against, if other educational institutions are entitled to
received aid. The conditions for grant or non-grant of aid to educational
institutions have to be uniformly applied, whether it is a majority-run
institution or a minority-run institution. As in the case of a majority-run
institution, the moment a minority institution obtains a grant of aid,
Article 28 of the Constitution comes into play. When an educational
institution is maintained out of State funds, no religious institution can
be provided therein. Article 28(1) does not state that it applies only to
educational institutions that are not established or maintained by
religious or linguistic minorities. Furthermore, upon the receipt of aid,
the provisions of Article 28(3) would apply to all educational institutions
whether run by the minorities or the non-minorities. Article 28(3) is the
right of a person studying in a state recognized institution or in an
educational institution receiving aid from state funds, not to take part in
any religious instruction, if imparted by such institution, without his/her
consent (or his/her guardian's consent if such a person is a minor). Just
as Article 28(1) and (3) become applicable the moment any educational
institution takes aid, likewise, Article 29(2) would also be attracted and
become applicable to an educational institution maintained by the state or
receiving aid out of state funds. It was strenuously contended that the
right to give admission is one of the essential ingredients of the right to
administer conferred on the religious or linguistic minority, and that this
right should not be curtailed in any manner. It is difficult to accept this
contention. If Article 23(1) and (3) apply to a minority institution that
receives aid out of state funds, there is nothing in the language of
Article 30 that would make the provisions of Article 29(2) inapplicable.
Like Article 28(1) and Article 28(3), Article 29(2) refers to ""any
educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of
State funds"". A minority institution would fall within the ambit of Article
29(2) in the same manner in which Article 28(1) and Article 28(3) would be
applicable to an aided minority institution. it is true that one of the
rights to administer an educational institution is to grant admission to
the students. As long as an educational institution, whether belonging to
the minority or the majority community, does not receive aid, it would, in
our opinion, be its right and discretion to grant admission to such
students as it chooses or selects subject to what has been clarified
before. Out of the various rights that the minority institution has in the
administration of the institution, Article 29(2) curtails the right to
grant admission to a certain extent. By virtue of Article 29(2), no citizen
can be denied admission by an aided minority institution on the grounds
only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. It is no doubt true
that Article 29(2) does curtail one of the powers of the minority
institution, but on receiving aid, some of the rights that an unaided
minority institution has are also curtailed by Article 28(1) and 28(3). A
minority educational institution has a right to impart religious
instruction - this right is taken away by Article 28(1), if that minority
institution is maintained wholly out of state funds. Similarly on receiving
aid out of state funds or on being recognized by the state, the absolute
right of a minority institution requiring a student to attend religious
instruction is curtailed by Article 28(3). If the curtailment of the right
to administer a minority institution on receiving aid or being wholly
maintained out of state funds as provided by Article 28 is valid, there is
no reason why Article 29(2) should not be held to be applicable. There is
nothing in the language of Article 28(1) and (3), Article 29(2) and Article
30 to suggest that on receiving aid, Article 28(1) and (3) will apply, but
Article 29(2) will not. Therefore, the contention that the institutions
covered by Article 30 are outside the injunction of Article 29(2) cannot be
accepted.",

28. The appellant contends that the protection
extended by Article 30(1) cannot be used


            against a member of the teaching staff who
            belongs to the same minority community. It is
            contended that a minority institution cannot
            ignore the rights of eligible lecturers belonging
            to the same community, senior to the person
            proposed to be selected, merely because the
            institution has the right to select a Principal of
            its choice. But this contention ignores the
            position that the right of the minority to select
            a Principal of its choice is with reference to
            the assessment of the person's outlook and
            philosophy and ability to implement its
            objects. The management is entitled to
            appoint the person, who according to them is
            most suited to head the institution, provided
            he possesses the qualifications prescribed for
            the posts. The career advancement prospects
            of the teaching staff, even those belonging to
            the same community, should have to yield to
            the right of the management under Article
            30(1) to establish and administer educational
            institutions.""",
Article 28,"T.A.K. Mohideen Pichai Taraganar vs Tinnevelly Mills Co. Ltd. And Ors. on 1 November, 1927",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1614093/?formInput=Article%2028,,"13. To begin with: it must be pointed out that the expression "" transfer "" by itself is not altogether appropriate to indicate a sale in invitum by the Court. No doubt the expression "" transfer "" has been used in such collocations as "" transfers by operation of law,"" but at the same time the expression "" transfer "" is undoubtedly more appropriate to indicate what is effected or brought about by the will of the person in whom the property is vested, as in the Transfer of Property Act.

14. Apart from that, the Articles of Association beginning with 28 are headed as '""shares transmission"" as contrasted with ""shares transfer"" which is the heading given to Articles 19 to 27. The expression "" transmission "" is undoubtedly more appropriate than the word ""transfer"" for indicating assignments effected by some agency other than the transferrer, and one has only to look at the terms and provisions of Articles 28 to 30 to find out that such is really the case. Articles 19 to 27 obviously deal only with transfers of shares by the shareholders and 23 to 30 with assignments brought about by other agencies. Having regard to this contradiction, not only indicated but laid down by the Articles, it is impossible to accept the contention that the assignment resulting on the sale by the Court should be regarded as falling under the expression "" transfer of shares "" in the Articles of Association. Articles 20 to 27, therefore, have no bearing whatever on the point. If none of the said Articles apply, it follows that no provision therein contained with regard to the discretion of the company to register the shares is available as a ground of refusal in the case under consideration. It follows also that no other formalities required by any of the said articles can be insisted on.



15. The next argument of the learned vakil for the respondents, and in fact the argument that gave me trouble, was the one based on Article 28. That article is the first under the heading of "" shares transmission."" Mr. Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar contended that as that article applied to cases of transmission of shares and as it is provided in that article that the executors or administrators of a deceased member shall be the only members recognized by the company as having any title to the shares of such member, the plaintiff was not entitled to require the company to register the shares in his name unless and until he produces letters of administration to the estate of the deceased or establishes his rights as executor of the last will and testament of the deceased member.



17. Stated in brief, the contention of defendant-respondent 1 with regard to this aspect of the case was as follows; Article 28 makes a provision in respect of shares registered in the company in the name of a person who is since deceased. That is this case. Therefore, the shares in question are the shares of such member, that is to say, the shares of a deceased member; and, therefore, in respect of the shares of a deceased member Article 28 provides that executors and administrators of a deceased member shall be the only persons recognized by the company as having any title to such shares.



18. At first sight I was myself inclined to think that there was considerable force in such an argument, especially having regard to the very curious wording of Article 28.

19. I, however, felt impelled to examine the wording of the article more carefully because it appeared to me that the contention, if accepted, would lead frequently to absurd and even monstrous results. My disinclination to accept the contention without further examination was strengthened when I found that the terms of Article 23 are really copied from the general articles as set out in the schedule to the Companies Act itself, which again are taken almost verbatim from the forms in the English Act.",

Jain Sabha (Of Rawalpindi), Delhi ... vs Union Of India And Ors. on 5 February, 1975",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/493894/?formInput=Article%2028,,"(47) With the same carefulness Sub-clause (b) in Sub-Article (2) of Article 25 clarified that the reference to Hindus in that sub-clause would be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jains or Budhist religion.  

 (48) The words ""Hindu religious institutions"" occurring in Article 25, Explanation Ii, have similarity with the words ""maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes"" found in clause (a) of Article 26. If the Hindus were to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes within Article 26(a), Article 25 including Explanation Ii was to apply to such institutions. While the words ""to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes"" occur in Article' 26, the words ""educational institution"" occur in Article 28, Sub-Articles (1), (2) and (3).  



 (49) Reserving right to freedom of religion the State by itself was to be independent of all religions and Article 28(1) throws a flood of light on the concept that the State was to be secular. No religious. instruction was to be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. While preserving the freedoms contained in Articles 25 to 28 an imperative impediment was designedly coined to impose an obligation on all educational institutions ""wholly maintained out of the State funds"" not to provide any religious instruction. The State was to stand above all religions.  



 (50) The deliberations in the Constituent Assembly were very careful and while enacting sub-Article (1) in Article 28, a proviso was enacted in the garb of Sub-Article (2). Where an institution .was to stem out of any endowment or trust, which was -to require the imparting of religious instruction, then even though later on the State was to administer it, the original intendment of the endowment or the trust was to be carried out. Sub-Article (3) in Article 28 is significantly relevant to the interpretation of Articles 26(a), 29, and 30. Article 28(3) is : ""28. (3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out of State funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such institution or to attend any Others Vs. Union Of India And Others religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his consent thereto.



 (51) In the course of enacting Article 28, the authors of the Constitution were attending to all possible future contingencies and drawing clear distinction between the maintenance of institutions for religious and charitable purposes and to conduct of educational institutions. Firstly, by Sub-Article (1), it was provided that no religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintained out of State funds. Even then a departure was made in terms of Sub-Article (2) to preserve the consequences of an endowment or trust. Sub-Article (3) in Article 28 made a further distinction inasmuch as even where the institution was merely to be receiving aid out of State funds no person attending it was to be required to take part in any religious instruction or to attend any religious worship except where he was to give his consent or if he was a minor his gardian was to give consent. It is clearly borne out that a distinction was being drawn between the institutions purely religious and charitable' and those which were to be ""educational institutions"". Article 26(a) is : ""26. Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right (a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and cheritable purposes."" It is obvious that the words ""religious denomination"" have been used in a wider sense and would include all religions whether they be in majority or minority in a particular State or a Union Territory.",
Article 28,"Constituent Assembly Debates On 19 November, 1948",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/682692/?formInput=Article%2028,,"Since the Member concerned is not here, Amendment No.842 falls through. 

Amendment Nos. 843 to 846 - Mr. Naziruddin Ahmad. 

Mr. Naziruddin Ahmad: I shall be moving Nos. 843, 844and 846 I shall not be moving No. 845. 

Sir, I move: 

""That in article 28, the words 'unless the context otherwise requires' be omitted."" 

""That in article 28, for the word 'requires', the word'indicates' be substituted."" 

""That in article 28, for the words 'the State', the word 'State' be substituted."" 

With regard to my first amendment for the deletion of the words ""unless the context otherwise requires"", I beg only to submit this. There are only a few articles in this part. This article attempts to define""the State"" to mean States in part III of the Constitution.I submit that there is here no difficulty or any confusion.If we say ""unless the context otherwise requires"" it would indicate that the meaning that has been definitely given by article 28 to the expression ""the State"" is subject to fluctuation in accordance with the context, that is inaccordance with the individual approach of each man. This would create an uncertainty and a very needless uncertainty in the context. I would submit that the word should be precisely defined. In fact the word ""State"" has been defined in so many places to mean so many things that there has already been a sufficient amount of confusion in the understanding of the word ""State"" and the introduction of these words ""unless the context otherwise requires"" would introduce further complications. I therefore submit that these words should be removed and, if necessary, doubts in any particular context should be met by a proper change in draftsmanship. 



The Honourable Dr. B. R. Ambedkar: Sir, I oppose the amendments of my friend, Mr. Naziruddin Ahmad. The words""the State"" in Article 28 have been used deliberately. In this Constitution, the word ""State"" has been used in two different senses. It is used as the collective entity,either representing the Centre or the Province, both of which in certain parts of the Constitution are spoken of as""State"". But the word used there is in a collective sense.Here the words ""the State"" are used both in a collective sense as well as in the distributive sense. If my friend were to refer to part III, which begins with article 7 of the Constitution, he will see in what sense the word ""State""is used. In this part, unless the context otherwise requires, ""the State"" includes the Government and theParliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India. So that, so far as the Directive Principles are concerned, even a village panchayat or a district or local board would be a State also. In order to distinguish the sense in which we have used the word we have thought it desirable to speak of 'State' and also 'the State'. Honourable Members will find this distinction also made in Article 12 of the Constitution. There we say: 



Mr. Vice-President: I shall now put these three amendments to vote. The question is: 

""That in article 28, the words 'unless the context otherwise requires' be omitted."" 

The amendment was negatived. 

Mr. Vice-President: The question is: 

""That in article 28, for the word ""requires' the word 'indicates' be substituted."" 

The amendment was negatived. 

Mr. Vice-President: The question is: 

""That article 28, for the words 'the State', the word 'State' be substituted."" 

The amendment was negatived. 



Mr. Vice-President: I shall put Article 28 to vote. Thequestion is: 

""That article 28 form part of the Constitution.""

""That for article 29, the following be substituted:",
Article 28,"T.M.A. Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1596666/?formInput=Article%2028,,"86.		Article 28(1) prohibits any educational institution, which is wholly
maintained out of state funds, to provide for religious instruction.  Moral education
dissociated from any denominational doctrine is not prohibited; but, as the state is
intended to be secular, an educational institution wholly maintained out of state
funds cannot impart or provide for any religious instruction.

87.		The exception to Article 28(1) is contained in Article 28(2). Article
28(2) deals with cases where, by an endowment or trust, an institution is
established, and the terms of the endowment or the trust require the imparting of
religious instruction, and where that institution is administered by the state.	 In
such a case, the prohibition contained in Article 28(1) does not apply.	 If the
administration of such an institution is voluntarily given to the government, or the
government, for a good reason and in accordance with law, assumes or takes over
the management of that institution, say on account of mal-administration, then the
government, on assuming the administration of the institution, would be obliged to
continue with the imparting of religious instruction as provided by the endowment
or the trust.



88.		While Article 28(1) and Article 28(2) relate to institutions that are
wholly maintained out of state funds, Article 28(3) deals with an educational
institution that is recognized by the state or receives aid out of state funds.	 Article
28(3) gives the person attending any educational institution the right not to take
part in any religious instruction, which may be imparted by an institution
recognized by the state, or receiving aid from the state.  Such a person also has the
right not to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such an
institution, or in any premises attached thereto, unless such a person, or if he/she is
a minor, his/her guardian, has given his/her consent.  The reading of Article 28(3)
clearly shows that no person attending an educational institution can be required to
take part in any religious instruction or any religious worship, unless the person or
his/her guardian has given his/her consent thereto, in a case where the educational
institution has been recognized by the state or receives aid out of its funds.	We
have seen that Article 26(a) gives the religious denomination the right to establish
an educational institution, the religious denomination being either of the majority
community or minority community. In any institution, whether established by the
majority or a minority religion, if religious instruction is imparted, no student can
be compelled to take part in the said religious instruction or in any religious
worship.  An individual has the absolute right not to be compelled to take part in
any religious instruction or worship.  Article 28(3) thereby recognizes the right of
an individual to practice or profess his own religion.	In other words, in matters
relating to religious instruction or worship, there can be no compulsion where the
educational institution is either recognized by the state or receives aid from the
state.



100.		With reference to Article 29(2), the Court observed at page 1055,
while dealing with an argument based on Article 337 that ""likewise Article 29(2)
provides, inter alia, that no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational
institution receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste,
language or any of them"". Referring to Part III of the Constitution and to Articles
19 and 25 to 28 in particular, the Court said:-
""..Under Article 25 all persons are equally entitled, subject to
public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of Part
III, to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practise
and propagate religion.	 Article 26 confers the fundamental right to
every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to
public order, morality and health, to establish and maintain
institutions for religious and charitable purposes, to manage its own
affairs in matters of religion, to acquire property and to administer
such property in accordance with law.  The ideal being to constitute
India into a secular State, no religious instruction is, under Article
28(1), to be provided in any educational institution wholly
maintained out of State funds and under clause (3) of the same
Article no person attending any educational institution recognized by
the State or receiving aid out of State funds is to be required to take
part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in such
institution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted
in such institution or in any premises attached thereto unless such
person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has given his
consent thereto.  Article 29(1) confers on any section of the citizens
having a distinct language, script or culture of its own to have the
right of conserving the same.  Clause (2) of that Article provides that
no citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds on
grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.""



144.		It cannot be argued that no conditions can be imposed while giving
aid to a minority institution.	Whether it is an institution run by the majority or the
minority, all conditions that have relevance to the proper utilization of the grant-in-
aid by an educational institution can be imposed.  All that Article 30(2) states is
that on the ground that an institution is under the management of a minority,
whether based on religion or language, grant of aid to that educational institution
cannot be discriminated against, if other educational institutions are entitled to
receive aid.  The conditions for grant or non-grant of aid to educational institutions
have to be uniformly applied, whether it is a majority-run institution or a minority-
run institution.  As in the case of a majority-run institution, the moment a minority
institution obtains a grant of aid, Article 28 of the Constitution comes into play.
When an educational institution is maintained out of State funds, no religious
instruction can be provided therein.  Article 28(1) does not state that it applies only
to educational institutions that are not established or maintained by religious or
linguistic minorities.	Furthermore, upon the receipt of aid, the provisions of
Article 28(3) would apply to all educational institutions whether run by the
minorities or the non-minorities.  Article 28(3) is the right of a person studying in a
state recognized institution or in an educational institution receiving aid from state
funds, not to take part in any religious instruction, if imparted by such institution,
without his/her consent (or his/her guardian's consent if such a person is a minor).
Just as Article 28(1) and (3) become applicable the moment any educational
institution takes aid, likewise, Article 29(2) would also be attracted and become
applicable to an educational institution maintained by the state or receiving aid out
of state funds.	 It was strenuously contended that the right to give admission is one
of the essential ingredients of the right to administer conferred on the religious or
linguistic minority, and that this right should not be curtailed in any manner.	 It is
difficult to accept this contention. If Article 28(1) and (3) apply to a minority
institution that receives aid out of state funds, there is nothing in the language of
Article 30 that would make the provisions of Article 29(2) inapplicable.  Like
Article 28(1) and Article 28(3), Article 29(2) refers to ""any educational institution
maintained by the State or receiving aid out of State funds"".  A minority institution
would fall within the ambit of Article 29(2) in the same manner in which Article
28(1) and Article 28(3) would be applicable to an aided minority institution.  It is
true that one of the rights to administer an educational institution is to grant
admission to the students.  As long as an educational institution, whether belonging
to the minority or the majority community, does not receive aid, it would, in our
opinion, be its right and discretion to grant admission to such students as it chooses
or selects subject to what has been clarified before.  Out of the various rights that
the minority institution has in the administration of the institution, Article 29(2)
curtails the right to grant admission to a certain extent.  By virtue of Article 29(2),
no citizen can be denied admission by an aided minority institution on the grounds
only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.	 It is no doubt true that
Article 29(2) does curtail one of the powers of the minority institution, but on
receiving aid, some of the rights that an unaided minority institution has, are also
curtailed by Article 28(1) and 28(3).  A minority educational institution has a right
to impart religious instruction	 this right is taken away by Article 28(1), if that
minority institution is maintained wholly out of state funds.  Similarly on receiving
aid out of state funds or on being recognized by the state, the absolute right of a
minority institution requiring a student to attend religious instruction is curtailed by
Article 28(3).	If the curtailment of the right to administer a minority institution on
receiving aid or being wholly maintained out of state funds as provided by Article
28 is valid, there is no reason why Article 29(2) should not be held to be
applicable.  There is nothing in the language of Article 28(1) and (3), Article 29(2)
and Article 30 to suggest that, on receiving aid, Article 28(1) and (3) will apply,
but Article 29(2) will not.  Therefore, the contention that the institutions covered
by Article 30 are outside the injunction of Article 29(2) cannot be accepted.",

Company Law Board is unsustainable on facts and in law; that

the Company Law Board ought to have directed the respondent to

effect transfer of shares in the Register of the Company, as the

order of refusal does not qualify in terms of Article 15 of the

Memorandum and Articles of Association; that the interpretation

of Company Law Board on Articles 13 and 14 is unsustainable;

and that Article 28 cannot be interpreted in isolation, but has to

be understood by reading the same with the earlier Articles 13,

14 & 15, and the interpretation given by the Company Law Board

to Article 28 in the impugned order would virtually delete Article

13 to 17 and even Article 29.




                8. In the Cross Objection filed by the respondent

Company in the appeal, it is urged that the Company Law Board

erred in holding that the word 'hereinafter' employed in Article 28

is erroneously employed and that the same should read as

Co.App. 9/2008 and Cross Objection 58/2009




""aforementioned"", and the Company Law Board ought to have

seen that such finding would amount to re-writing the Articles,

which cannot be done in a petition under Section 111 of the Act;

that the Company Law Board while arriving at such finding

erroneously concluded that the word ""hereinafter""        would be

related to Article 29, which was the lone article succeeding Article
28, in the matter relating to shares, and that since the same was

of no relevance, the word ""hereinafter"" was erroneously

employed; and also that the finding of the Company Law Board

that Article 28 would be subject to Article 13 and 14 is therefore

erroneous. In the affidavit filed in support thereof, it is averred

that the delay in filing the cross objection is neither wilful nor

wanton, and in any event, since the same relates to the

interpretation of the Articles, which the Company is seeking to do

in the present appeal, no prejudice would be caused by such

cross objection being considered.



                19. The two Articles now left to be considered are

Articles 28 and 29. Article 28 enjoins upon the Board to act

subject to Section 111 and subject as hereinafter mentioned,

Co.App. 9/2008 and Cross Objection 58/2009




while exercising its discretion under Article 28. As per Article 29,

which contemplates that in the case of partly paid shares, an

application for registration is made by           the transferor, the

Company shall give notice of the application to the transferee in

accordance with the provisions of Section 110 of the Act.

Therefore, while the Board is exercising the power under Article
28, the Board could in no way act in accordance with Article 29,

and as per Article 28, the Board is free to exercise its discretion

independent of Article 29.




                25.      On a careful consideration of the various

provisions contained in the Articles of Association, we are of the

opinion that while Article 13 speaks about previous approval of

Co.App. 9/2008 and Cross Objection 58/2009




the Board in the matter of transfer of shares, other than the

transfer to an existing member, Article 14 again deals with the

transfer of shares by a shareholder either by way of gift or

otherwise, with or without consideration to the relations

enumerated therein,           whereas, Article 28 speaks about the

power of the Board to decline registration in its discretion subject

to provisions contained in Section 111.       To say that, in the case

of an existing member, Article 28 will not apply, will only render

the said provision otiose, as far as the existing member is

concerned.        Though express words of non obstante clause as

such is found in Article 28, when it gives the discretion to refuse

registration, subject to the provisions of Section 111, all that it

require to be done is to exercise the power, subject to the

provisions contained therein. In other words, it is an accepted

principle of interpretation that all the provisions should be given

due meaning and effect, so that           none of the provisions    is

rendered superfluous. If Articles 13 and 14 are exhaustive, there

is no need to provide a separate Article like Article 28, the power

being exercised        subject to the limitation prescribed under

Co.App. 9/2008 and Cross Objection 58/2009



Section 111.      The statutory power is thus not intended to be

denuded by Articles 13 and 14 of the Articles of Association of the

Company, and the power under Section 111 is reiterated under

Article 28, thus fully effective over Article 13 and 14, and it is a

residuary power of the Board.",

educational rights. Article 29(1) gives the right to any section of the
citizens residing in India or any part thereof, and having a distinct
language, script or culture of its own, to conserve the same. Article 29(1)
does not refer to any religion, even though the marginal note of the
Article mentions the interests of minorities. Article 29(1) essentially
refers to sections of citizens who have a distinct language script or
culture, even though their religion may not be the same. The common thread
that runs through Article 29(1) in language, script or culture, and not
religion. For example, if in any part of the country, there is a section of
society that has a distinct language, they are entitled to conserve the
same, even though the persons having that language may profess different
religions. Article 29(1) gives the right to all sections of citizens,
whether they are in a minority or the majority religions, to conserve their
language, script or culture.



108. Out attention was invited to the decision in Rev. Father W. Proost and
Ors. v. The State of Bihar and Ors., but the said case has no application
here. In that case, it was contended, on behalf of the State of Bihar, that
as the protection to the minority under Article 29(1) was only a right to
conserve a distinct language, script or culture of its own, the college did
not qualify for the protection of Article 30(1) because it was not founded
to conserve them and that consequently, it was open to all sections of the
people. The question, therefore, was whether the college could claim the
protection of Section 48-B of the Bihar Universities Act read with Article
30(1) of the Constitution, only if it proved that the educational
institution was furthering the rights mentioned in Article 29(1). Section
48-B of the Bihar Universities Act exempted a minority educational
institution based on religion or language from the operation of some of the
other provisions of that Act. This Court, while construing Article 30, held
that its width could not be cut down by introducing in it considerations on
which Article 29(1) was based. Article 29(1) and 30(1) were held to create
two separate rights, though it was possible that they might meet in a given
case. While dealing with the contention of the state that the college would
not be entitled to the protection under Article 30(1) because it was open
to all sections of the people, the Court referred to the observations in
the Kerala Education Bill case, wherein it had been observed that the real
import of Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) was that they contemplated a
minority institution with a sprinkling of outsiders admitted into it. The
Court otherwise had no occasion to deal with the applicability of Article
29(2) to Article 30(1).



144. It cannot be argued that no conditions can be imposed while giving aid
to a minority institution. Whether it is an institution run by the majority
or the minority, all conditions that have relevance to the proper
utilization of the grant-in-aid by an educational institution can be
imposed. All that Article 30(2) states is that on the ground that an
institution is under the management of a minority, whether based on
religion or language, grant of aid to that educational institution cannot
be discriminated against, if other educational institutions are entitled to
received aid. The conditions for grant or non-grant of aid to educational
institutions have to be uniformly applied, whether it is a majority-run
institution or a minority-run institution. As in the case of a majority-run
institution, the moment a minority institution obtains a grant of aid,
Article 28 of the Constitution comes into play. When an educational
institution is maintained out of State funds, no religious institution can
be provided therein. Article 28(1) does not state that it applies only to
educational institutions that are not established or maintained by
religious or linguistic minorities. Furthermore, upon the receipt of aid,
the provisions of Article 28(3) would apply to all educational institutions
whether run by the minorities or the non-minorities. Article 28(3) is the
right of a person studying in a state recognized institution or in an
educational institution receiving aid from state funds, not to take part in
any religious instruction, if imparted by such institution, without his/her
consent (or his/her guardian's consent if such a person is a minor). Just
as Article 28(1) and (3) become applicable the moment any educational
institution takes aid, likewise, Article 29(2) would also be attracted and
become applicable to an educational institution maintained by the state or
receiving aid out of state funds. It was strenuously contended that the
right to give admission is one of the essential ingredients of the right to
administer conferred on the religious or linguistic minority, and that this
right should not be curtailed in any manner. It is difficult to accept this
contention. If Article 23(1) and (3) apply to a minority institution that
receives aid out of state funds, there is nothing in the language of
Article 30 that would make the provisions of Article 29(2) inapplicable.
Like Article 28(1) and Article 28(3), Article 29(2) refers to ""any
educational institution maintained by the State or receiving aid out of
State funds"". A minority institution would fall within the ambit of Article
29(2) in the same manner in which Article 28(1) and Article 28(3) would be
applicable to an aided minority institution. it is true that one of the
rights to administer an educational institution is to grant admission to
the students. As long as an educational institution, whether belonging to
the minority or the majority community, does not receive aid, it would, in
our opinion, be its right and discretion to grant admission to such
students as it chooses or selects subject to what has been clarified
before. Out of the various rights that the minority institution has in the
administration of the institution, Article 29(2) curtails the right to
grant admission to a certain extent. By virtue of Article 29(2), no citizen
can be denied admission by an aided minority institution on the grounds
only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them. It is no doubt true
that Article 29(2) does curtail one of the powers of the minority
institution, but on receiving aid, some of the rights that an unaided
minority institution has are also curtailed by Article 28(1) and 28(3). A
minority educational institution has a right to impart religious
instruction - this right is taken away by Article 28(1), if that minority
institution is maintained wholly out of state funds. Similarly on receiving
aid out of state funds or on being recognized by the state, the absolute
right of a minority institution requiring a student to attend religious
instruction is curtailed by Article 28(3). If the curtailment of the right
to administer a minority institution on receiving aid or being wholly
maintained out of state funds as provided by Article 28 is valid, there is
no reason why Article 29(2) should not be held to be applicable. There is
nothing in the language of Article 28(1) and (3), Article 29(2) and Article
30 to suggest that on receiving aid, Article 28(1) and (3) will apply, but
Article 29(2) will not. Therefore, the contention that the institutions
covered by Article 30 are outside the injunction of Article 29(2) cannot be
accepted.



149. Although the right to administer includes within it a right to grant
admission to students of their choice under Article 30(1), when such a
minority institution is granted the facility of receiving grant-in-aid,
Article 29(2) would apply, and necessarily, therefore, one of the right of
administration of the minorities would be eroded to some extent. Article
30(2) is an injunction against the state not to discriminate against the
minority educational institution and prevent it from receiving aid on the
ground that the institution is under the management of a minority. While,
therefore, a minority educational institution receiving grant-in-aid would
not be completely outside the discipline of Article 29(2) of the
Constitution by no stretch of imagination can the rights guaranteed under
Article 30(1) be annihilated. It is this context that some interplay
between Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) is required. As observed quite
aptly in St. Stephen's case ""the fact that Article 29(2) applies to
minorities as well as non-minorities does not mean that it was intended to
nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Article 30(1)."" The
word ""only"" used in Article 29(2) is of considerable significance and has
been used for some avowed purpose. Denying admission to non-minorities for
the purpose of accommodating minority students to a reasonable extent will
not be only on grounds of religion etc., but is primarily meant to preserve
the minority character of the institution and to effectuate the guarantee
under Article 30(1). The best possible way is to hold that as long as the
minority educational institution permits admission of citizens belonging to
the non-minority class to a reasonable extent based upon merit, it will not
be an infraction of Article 29(2), even though the institution admits
students of the minority group of its own choice for whom the institution
was meant. What would be a reasonable extent would depend upon variable
factors, and it may not be advisable to fix any specific percentage. The
situation would vary according to the type of institution and the nature of
education that is being imparted in the institution. Usually, at the school
level, although it may be possible to fill up all the seats with students
of the minority group, at the higher level, either in colleges or in
technical institutions, it may not be possible to fill up all the seats
with the students of the minority group. However, even if it is possible to
fill up all the seats with students of the minority group, the moment the
institution is granted aid, the institution will have to admit students of
the non-minority group to a reasonable extent, whereby the character of the
institution is not annihilated, and at the same time, the rights of the
citizen engrafted under Article 29(2) are not subverted. It is for this
reason that a variable percentage of admission of minority students
depending on the type of institution and education is desirable, and
indeed, necessary, to promote the constitutional guarantee enshrined in
both Article 29(2) and Article 30.",
Article 29,"T.M.A. Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors (With Other ... on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/665015/?formInput=Article%2029,,"""Article 29(1) gives protection to any section of the citizens having a
distinct language, script or culture by guaranteeing their right to conserve
the same.  Article 30(1) secures to all minorities whether based on religion
or language, the right to establish and administer educational institutions
of their choice. Now, suppose the State maintains an educational
institution to help conserving the distinct language, script or culture of a
section of the citizens or makes grants-in-aid of an educational institution
established by a minority community based on religion or language to
conserve their distinct language, script or culture who can claim the
protection of Article 29(2) in the matter of admission into any such
institution.?  Surely, the citizens of the very section whose language, script
or culture is sought to be conserved by the institution or the citizen who
belonged to the minority group which has established and is administering
the institution, do not need any protection against themselves and
therefore, Article 29(2) is not designed for the protection of this section or
this minority.	 Nor do we see any reason to limit article 29(2) to citizens
belonging to a minority group other than the section or the minorities
referred to in article 29(1) or article 30(1), for the citizens, who do not
belong to any minority group, may quite conceivably need this protection
just as much as the citizens of such other minority groups.  If it is urged
that the citizens of the majority group are amply protected by article 15
and do not require the protection of article 29(2), then there are several
obvious answers to that argument.  The language of article 29(2) is wide
and unqualified and may well cover all citizens whether they belong to the
majority or minority group.  Article 15 protects all citizens against the
State whereas the protection of article 29(2) extents against the State or
any body who denies the right conferred by it.	Further article 15 protects
all citizens against discrimination generally, but article 29(2) is a
protection against a particular species of wrong namely denial of
admission into educational institutions of the specified kind.	In the next
place article 15 is quite general and wide in its terms and applies to all
citizens, whether they belong to the majority or minority groups, and gives
protection to all the citizens against discrimination by the State on certain
specific grounds.  Article 29(2) confers a special right on citizens for
admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the State.
To limit this right only to citizens belonging to minority groups will be to
provide a double protection for such citizens and to hold that the citizens
of the majority group have no special educational rights in the nature of a
right to be admitted into an educational institution for the maintenance of
which they make contributions by way of taxes.	We see no cogent reason
for such discrimination.



	It was then urged that if the intention of the framers of the
Constitution was to make Article 30(1) subject to Article 29(2), the
appropriate place where it should have found place was Article 30(1) itself
rather than in Article 29 and, therefore, Article 29(2) cannot be treated as an
exception to article 30(1).  There is no merit in the contention.  It is earlier
noticed that clause (18) when was placed before the Constituent Assembly
contained the provisions of Article 29(1)(2) and 30(1)(2) and  all were
numbered as clause 18(1) (2) (3)(a) (b).  Again when clause (18) was
transposed in draft Article 23, Article 29(1)(2) and Article 30(1)(2)  both
were together in draft Article 23.  Shri Thakur Dass Bhargava's amendment
which was accepted was in relation to clause (2) of Article 23	which
ultimately has become Article 29(2).  It is for that reason Article 29(2) finds
place in Article 29.



	It was also urged that if the framers of the Constitution intended to
carve out an exception to Article 30(1), they could have used the words
""subject to the provisions contained in article 29(2)"" in the beginning of
Article 30(1) or could have used the expression ""notwithstanding"" in the
beginning of article 29(2) and in absence of such words it cannot be held
that Article 29(2) is an exception to Article 30(1).	Reference in this regard
was made to Articles 25 and 26 which contained qualifying words.  In fact,
the structural argument was based on the absence of qualifying words either
in Article 29(2) or 30(1).  This argument based on structure of Articles 29(2)
and 30(1) has no merit. In fact, it overlooks that the intention of the framers
of the Constitution was to confer rights consistent with the other members of
society and to promote rather than imperil national interest.  It may be noted
that there is a difference in the language of Articles 25 and 26.  The
qualifying words of Article 25 are ""subject to public order, morality and
health and to the other provisions of this part"".  The opening words of
Article 26 are ""subject to public order, morality and health"".	The absence of
words ""to the other provisions of this part"" as occurring in Article 25 in
Art.26 does not mean that Article 26 is over and above other rights conferred
in Part-III of the Constitution.  In The Durgah Committee, Ajmer & Anr.
vs. Syed Hussain Ali & Ors.  1962(1) SCR 383 and Tilkayat Shri
Govindlalji Maharaj vs. The State of Rajasthan & Ors.  1964(1) SCR
561, it has been held that Article 26 is subject to Article 25 irrespective of
the fact that the words "" subject to other provisions of this part"" occurring in
Article 25 is absent in Article 26.  For these reasons, it must be held that
even if there are no qualifying expressions ""subject to other provisions of
this part"" and ""notwithstanding anything"" either in Article 30(1) or Article
29(2), Article 30(1) is subject to Article 29(2) of the Constitution.



	There is another factor which shows that Article 30(1) is subject to
Article 29(2).	If Article 29(2) is meant for the benefit of minority, there was
no sense in using the word 'caste' in article 29(2).   The word 'caste' is
unheard of in religious minority communities and, therefore, Article 29(2)
was never intended by the framers of the Constitution to confer any
exclusive rights to the minorities.

Although Article 30(1) strictly may not be subject to reasonable
restrictions, it cannot be disputed that Article 30(1) is subject to Article
28(3) and also general laws and the laws made in the interests of national
security, public order, morality and the like governing such institutions will
have to be necessarily read into Article 30(1). In that view of the matter the
decision by this Court in Rev. Sidhajbhai (supra) that under Article 30(1)
fundamental right conferred on minorities is in terms absolute is not borne
out of that Article.  It, therefore, cannot be held that the fundamental right
guaranteed under Article 30(1) is absolute in terms.  Thus, looking into the
precedents, historical fact and Constituent Assembly debates and also
interpreting Articles 29(2) and 30(1) contextually and textually, the irrestible
conclusion is that Article 30(1) is subject to Article 29(2) of the
Constitution.",
Article 29,"THE CONSTITUTION (FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951",https://indiankanoon.org/doc/136460171/,,,
Article 29,"The Ahmedabad St. Xaviers College ... vs State Of Gujarat & Anr on 26 April, 1974",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/703393/?formInput=Article%2029,,"Article,  30(1) cannot be whittled down by reading it  along
with,  article 29(1).The differences between  article  30(1)
and  29(1) are unmistakable : while article 29	confers	 the
fundamental  right to ""any section. of the  citizens""  which
would  include the majority section.  Article 30(1)  confers
the  right  only  on  minorities.  While  article 29(1)  is
concerned with ""Language, script or culture"", article  30(1)
deals  with divisions of the nation based on  ""religion	 or.
language""; while article 29(1) is concerned with. the  right
to conserve language, script or culture article 30(1)  deals
with  the  right to establish  and  administer	""educational
institutions""  of  the	minorities' own	 choice.   The	word
""administer""  is a word of very wide import.  The other	 key
word&  are  ""of	 their choice"".	 The  minorities,  right  to
administer must necessarily include (i) the right to  choose
its  managing  or governing body; (ii) the right not  to  be
compelled  to refuse admission to students; (iii) the  right
to  choose  its	 teachers;  and (4) the	 right	to  use	 its
properties   and   assets  for	the  benefit  of   its	 own
institution,
Although the minority institutions can claim the  protection
under  Article 30 there are certain activities which  cannot
possibly  be considered educational as for example a  school
of  pickpockets or where subversive or	criminal  activities
are taught.  Such institutions cannot invoke the  protection
of  Article' 30 because they are not imparting education  at
all.  Though the freedom under Article 30 is Unqualified  in
terms,	it  is not free from regulations, There	 can  be  no
absolutes  in a community governed by law.   Accordingly  an
educational  institution  must	comply with  the  laws	like
municipal  laws	 regarding construction and  maintenance  of
buildings.  labour laws, tax laws and so on.  Under  article
30  the permissible regulatory measures are those  which  do
not  restrict the right of. administration to facilitate  it
and  ensure better and more effective exercise of the  right
for   the  benefit  of	the  institution  and  through	 the
instrumentality	  of  the  management  of  the	 educational
institutions, but without displacing the management.  If the
administration	has  to be improved it must be	through	 the
agency or instrumentality of the existing management and not
by   displacing	  it.	 Restrictions  on   the	  right	  of
administration imposed in the interest of the general public
alone  and  not in the interest of and for  the	 benefit  of
minority educational institutions are permissible.
There  is a fundamental distinction between  restriction  on
the right of administration and a regulation prescribing the
manner of administration.  The right of administration means
the  right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs  of
the institutions.  It postulates autonomy in administration.
The right' of administration means the right to conduct	 and
manage the affairs of the institution through a Committee or
body  of  persons  in whom the	management  have  faith	 and
confidence and who have full autonomy in that sphere subject
to  permissible	 regulatory measures, the  right  to  impart
education through one's own teachers having regard to  their
compatibility  with  the ideals and  aims,  aspirations	 and
traditions of the institution.	Educational institutions  do
not want a teacher who though brilliant but is	cantankerous
or  quarrelsome	 or  who is antipathetic to  the  creed	 and
beliefs and practices of the religious minority.  The  right
includes the right to admit students of their choice subject
to  reasonable	regulations about  academic  qualifications.
The  right  to	select and appoint one's  own  teachers	 and
principal  the	right to enforce  discipline  by  exercising



The  minority  institutions which are in truth	and  reality
educational  institutions  where education  in	its  various
aspects is imparted claim protection of Article 30.
This  raises the question at the threshold whether  Articles
30(1) and 29(1) of the Constitution are mutually exclusive.
Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution are grouped under the
heading	 ""Cultural and educational rights"".   Article 29(1)
deals with right of any section of the citizens residing  in
India  to  preserve  their  language,  script  or   culture.
Article.,  30(1) provides that all religious and  linguistic
minorities have the right to establish and administer educa-
tional	 institutions  of  their  choice.    Article 29(2)
prohibits  discrimination  in  matters	of  admission	into
educational  institutions of the types mentioned therein  on
grounds	 only of religion, race, caste, language or  any  of
them.	Article	 30(2)	prevents  States  from	making	 any
discrimination	 against  any  educational  institution	  in
granting  aid  on  the	ground that  it	 is  managed  by-  a
religious or linguistic minority.



			    191
Articles 29 and 30 Confer four distinct rights.   First  is
the  right  of	any  section of	 the  resident	citizens  to
conserve  its own language, script culture as  mentioned  in
Article 29(1).	 Second is the right of 'all  religious	 and
linguistic   minorities	  to   establish   and	  administer
educational  institutions  of their choice as  mentioned  in
Article	 30(1),.   Third  is the  right	 of  an	 educational
institution not to be discriminated against in the matter of
State aid on the ground that it is under the management of a
religious  or  linguistic minority as mentioned	 in  Article
30(2).	Fourth is the right of the citizen not to be  denied
admission   into  any  State  maintained  or   State   aided
educational  institution on the ground of  religion,  caste,
race or language, as mentioned in Article 29(2).
It  will be wrong to read Article 30(1) as  restricting	 the
right of minorities to establish and administer	 educational
institutions  of  their	 choice only  to  cases	 where	such
institutions are concerned with language, script or  culture
of  the minorities.  The reasons are these.  First,  Article
29  confers  the  fundamental right on any  section  of	 the
citizens  which	 will include the majority  section  whereas
Article 30(1) confers the right on all minorities.   Second,
Article 29(1) is concerned with language, script or culture,
whereas	 Article 30(1) deals with minorities of	 the  nation
based  on  religion or language.  'third, Article 29(1)  is
concerned  with	 the right to conserve language,  script  or
culture,  where	 as Article 30(1) deals with  the  right  to
establish  and	administer educational institutions  of	 the
minorities  of	their choice.  Fourth, the  conservation  of
language,  script or culture under Article 29(1) may  be  by
means  wholly unconnected with educational institutions	 and
similarly  establishment and administration  of	 educational
institutions  by  a  minority under  Article  30(1)  may  be
unconnected with any motive to conserve language, script  or
culture.   A  minority may administer  an  institution	for.
religious  education  which is wholly unconnected  with	 any
question of conserving a language, script or culture.
If  the,  scope	 of  Article  30(1)  is	 to  establish	 and
administer  educational institutions to	 conserve  language,
script	or culture of minorities, it will render Article  30
redundant.  If rights under Articles 29(1) and 30(1) are the
same  then  the	 consequence will be  that  any	 section  of
citizens not necessarily linguistic or religious  minorities
will have the right to establish and administer	 educational
institutions of their choice.  The scope of Article 30 rests
on  linguistic or religious minorities and no other  section
of citizens of India has such a right.



This Court in Rev.  Father Proost v. State of Bihar [1969] 2
S.C.R.	73  considered the question whether  the  protection
guaranteed. under Article 30.(1) is a corollary to the right
guaranteed  under Article 29(1).  A contention was  advanced
that  protection to minorities in Article 29(1) was  only  a
right to conserve a distinct language, script, or culture of
its own, and, therefore, the educational institutions  which
imparted general education did not qualify for protection of
Article	 30.  This Court said that the, width of Article  30
could  not be cut down by, introducing any consideration  on
which  Article 29(1) is based.	Article, 29(1) is a  general
protection  given to sections of citizens to conserve  their
language, script or culture.  Article 30,is a special  right
to minorities to establish educational institutions of their
choice.	  This Court said that the two Articles	 create	 two
separate rights though it is possible that the rights  might
meet in a given case.",
Article 29,"Society For Un-Aided P.School Of Raj vs U.O.I & Anr on 12 April, 2012",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/154958944/?formInput=Article%2029,,"15.    Article 29(1) confers on any section of the citizens a right  to
    conserve its own language, script or culture by and through educational
    institutions and makes it obvious that a minority  could  conserve  its
    language, script or culture and,  therefore,  the  right  to  establish
    institutions of its choice is a necessary concomitant to the  right  to
    conserve its distinctive language, script or culture and that right  is
    conferred on all minorities by Article 30(1).  That right, however,  is
    subject to the right conferred by Article 29(2).



 19.    The above well-settled principles have to be seen in the context
    of the 2009 Act enacted to implement Article 21A of  the  Constitution.
    At the very outset, the question that arises  for  determination  is  –
    what was the intention of the Parliament?  Is the 2009 Act intended  to
    apply to unaided minority schools?  In answer to the above question, it
    is important to note that in the case of P.A. Inamdar, this Court  held
    that there shall be no reservations in  private  unaided  colleges  and
    that in that regard there shall be no difference between  the  minority
    and non-minority institutions.  However, by the  Constitution  (Ninety-
    third Amendment) Act, 2005, Article 15 is amended.  It is given Article
    15(5).  The result is that P.A.  Inamdar  has  been  overruled  on  two
    counts: (a) whereas this Court in P.A. Inamdar had  stated  that  there
    shall be no reservation in  private  unaided  colleges,  the  Amendment
    decreed that there shall be reservations; (b)  whereas  this  Court  in
    P.A. Inamdar had said that there shall be  no  difference  between  the
    unaided minority and non-minority institutions, the  Amendment  decreed
    that there shall be  a  difference.   Article   15(5)  is  an  enabling
    provision and it is  for  the  respective  States  either  to  enact  a
    legislation or issue an executive instruction providing for reservation
    except in the case of minority educational institutions referred to  in
    Article 30(1).  The intention of the Parliament is  that  the  minority
    educational institution referred to in  Article  30(1)  is  a  separate
    category of institutions which needs protection of  Article  30(1)  and
    viewed in that light we are of the view that unaided minority school(s)
    needs special protection under Article  30(1). Article  30(1)  is  not
    conditional as Article 19(1)(g).  In a sense, it  is  absolute  as  the
    Constitution framers thought that it was the duty of the Government  of
    the day to protect the minorities in  the  matter  of  preservation  of
    culture,  language  and  script  via   establishment   of   educational
    institutions for religious and charitable purposes [See:  Article  26].
    Reservations of 25% in such unaided minority schools result in changing
    the character of the schools if right to establish and administer  such
    schools flows from the  right  to  conserve  the  language,  script  or
    culture, which right is conferred on  such  unaided  minority  schools.
    Thus, the 2009  Act  including  Section  12(1)(c)  violates  the  right
    conferred  on  such  unaided  minority  schools  under  Article  30(1).
    However, when we come to aided minority schools we have to keep in mind
    Article 29(2). As stated, Article 30(1) is subject  to  Article 29(2).
    The said Article confers right of admission upon every citizen  into  a
    State-aided  educational  institution.   Article 29(2)  refers  to  an
    individual right.  It is  not  a  class  right.   It  applies  when  an
    individual  is  denied  admission  into  an   educational   institution
    maintained or aided by the State.  The 2009 Act is  enacted  to  remove
    barriers such as financial barriers which restrict  his/her  access  to
    education.  It is enacted pursuant to Article 21A.  Applying the  above
    tests, we hold that the 2009 Act is constitutionally  valid  qua  aided
    minority schools.



    68.      Faced with many obstacles to achieve the above objectives  and
    the Directive Principles of the State Policy, Articles 15 and 16 of the
    Constitution had to be amended on several occasions so as to  get  over
    the obstacles in achieving the socio-economic  justice.   In  State  of
    Madras v. Shrimati Champakam Dorairajan [(1951) 2 SCR 525], this  Court
    laid down the law that Article 29(2) was not controlled by  Article  46
    of  the  Directive  Principles  of  the  State  Policy  and  that   the
    Constitution did not intend to protect the  interest  of  the  backward
    classes in the matter of admission to  educational  institutions.    In
    order to set right the law and to achieve social  justice,  Clause  (4)
    was added to Article 15 by the Constitutional  (First  Amendment)  Act,
    1951 enabling the State to make special provision for  the  advancement
    of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens  or  for
    the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.   The object of  Clause  (4)
    was to bring Articles 15 and 29 in line with Articles 16(4), 46 and 340
    of the Constitution, so as to make it constitutional for the  State  to
    reserve seats for  backward  classes  citizens,  Scheduled  Castes  and
    Scheduled Tribes in the public educational institutions, as well as  to
    make special provisions, as may be necessary, for the advancement, e.g.
    to provide housing accommodation for such classes.    In  other  words,
    Article 15(4) enables the State to do what would  otherwise  have  been
    unconstitutional.  Article 15(4) has to be read  as  a  proviso  or  an
    exception to Article 29(2) and if  any  provision  is  defined  by  the
    provisions of Article 15(4), its validity cannot be questioned  on  the
    ground that it violates Article 29(2).  Under Article 15(4), the  State
    is entitled to reserve a minimum number of seats  for  members  of  the
    backward  classes,  notwithstanding  Article 29(2)  and  the  obstacle
    created under Article 29(2)  has  been  removed  by  inserting  Article
    15(4).



     97.       I have in the  earlier  part  of  the  judgment  referred  to
     Article 28(1) and Article 29 of UNCRC which cast an obligation  on  the
     State to progressively achieve the rights of children and also to  make
     primary education compulsory and available free to all but all the same
     make it clear that no part of  Articles  28  and  29  be  construed  to
     interfere with the liberty of non-state actors.  They are  expected  to
     observe the principles set forth in Para 1 of Article 29  and  also  to
     conform to such minimum standards as laid down by the state.",
Article 29,"Pramati Educational & Cultural ... vs Union Of India & Ors on 6 May, 2014",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/32468867/?formInput=Article%2029,,"25.   We may now deal with the contention of Mr. Divan that  clause  (5)  of
    Article 15 of the  Constitution  is  violative  of  Article  14  of  the
    Constitution as it excludes from its purview the  minority  institutions
    referred to in clause (1) of Article 30  of  the  Constitution  and  the
    contention of Mr. Nariman that clause (5) of Article  15  excludes  both
    unaided minority institutions and aided minority institutions alike  and
    is thus violative of Article 14 of  the  Constitution.   Articles 29(2)
    30(1) and 30(2) of the Constitution, which are  relevant,  for  deciding
    these contentions, are quoted hereinbelow:



           “149. Although the right to  administer  includes  within  it  a
           right to grant admission  to  students  of  their  choice  under
           Article 30(1), when such a minority institution is  granted  the
           facility of receiving grant-in-aid,  Article 29(2) would  apply,
           and necessarily, therefore, one of the right  of  administration
           of  the   minorities   would   be   eroded   to   some   extent.
 Article 30(2) is  an  injunction  against  the  state   not   to
           discriminate against the minority  educational  institution  and
           prevent it from receiving aid on the ground that the institution
           is under the management  of  a  minority.  While,  therefore,  a
           minority educational institution  receiving  grant-in-aid  would
           not be completely outside the discipline of Article 29(2) of the
           Constitution  by  no  stretch  of  imagination  can  the  rights
           guaranteed  under  Article 30(1) be  annihilated.  It  is   this
           context   that   some   interplay   between    Article 29(2) and
           Article 30(1) is  required.  As  observed  quite  aptly   in St.
           Stephen's case   ""the   fact   that   Article 29(2) applies   to
           minorities as well as non-minorities does not mean that  it  was
           intended to nullify the special right guaranteed  to  minorities
           in Article 30(1)."" The word ""only"" used in  Article 29(2) is  of
           considerable significance and has  been  used  for  some  avowed
           purpose. Denying admission to non-minorities for the purpose  of
           accommodating minority students to a reasonable extent will  not
           be only on grounds of religion etc., but is primarily  meant  to
           preserve the  minority  character  of  the  institution  and  to
           effectuate the guarantee under Article 30(1). The best  possible
           way is  to  hold  that  as  long  as  the  minority  educational
           institution permits admission of citizens belonging to the  non-
           minority class to a reasonable extent based upon merit, it  will
           not  be  an  infraction  of  Article 29(2),  even   though   the
           institution admits students of the minority  group  of  its  own
           choice for whom the institution  was  meant.  What  would  be  a
           reasonable extent would depend upon variable factors, and it may
           not be advisable to fix any specific percentage.  The  situation
           would vary according to the type of institution and  the  nature
           of education that is being imparted in the institution. Usually,
           at the school level, although it may be possible to fill up  all
           the seats with students of the minority  group,  at  the  higher
           level, either in colleges or in technical institutions,  it  may
           not be possible to fill up all the seats with  the  students  of
           the minority group. However, even if it is possible to  fill  up
           all the seats with students of the minority  group,  the  moment
           the institution is granted aid, the  institution  will  have  to
           admit students of the non-minority group to a reasonable extent,
           whereby the character of the institution is not annihilated, and
           at the same time, the rights  of  the  citizen  engrafted  under
           Article 29(2) are not subverted. It is for this  reason  that  a
           variable percentage of admission of minority students  depending
           on the type of  institution  and  education  is  desirable,  and
           indeed,  necessary,  to  promote  the  constitutional  guarantee
           enshrined in both Article 29(2) and Article 30.”

Thus, the law as laid down by this Court is that the minority  character  of
an aided or unaided minority institution cannot be annihilated by  admission
of students from communities other than the  minority  community  which  has
established the institution, and whether such admission  to  any  particular
percentage of seats will destroy the minority character of  the  institution
or not will depend on a large  number  of  factors  including  the  type  of
institution.



 On the other hand, this Court has held in T.M.A. Pai Foundation  (supra)
    that  the  essence  of  secularism  in  India  is  the  recognition  and
    preservation of the different types of people,  with  diverse  languages
    and different beliefs and Articles 29  and  30  seek  to  preserve  such
    differences and at the same time unite the people of India to  form  one
    strong nation. (see paragraph 161 of the majority  judgment  of  Kirpal,
    C.J., in T.M.A. Pai  Foundation  at  page  587  of  the  SCC).   In  our
    considered opinion, therefore, by excluding  the  minority  institutions
    referred to in clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution, the secular
    character of India is maintained and not destroyed.

    in Writ Petition (C) No.1081 of 2013 (Muslim Minority Schools  Managers’
    Association) and Mr. T.R. Andhyarujina, learned senior counsel appearing
    for intervener in  Writ  Petition  (C)  No.60  of  2014  (La  Martineire
    Schools) that under Article 30(1) of the  Constitution  all  minorities,
    whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish
    and administer educational institutions of their choice.  They submitted
    that the State while making the  law  to  provide  free  and  compulsory
    education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years cannot  be
    allowed to encroach on this right of  the  minority  institutions  under
    Article 30(1) of the Constitution.  They referred to  the  decisions  of
    this Court right from the Kerala Educational Bill case to the T.M.A. Pai
    case (supra) to argue that admitting children other than  those  of  the
    minority community which establish the school cannot be forced upon  the
    minority institutions, whether aided or unaided.   They  submitted  that
    2009 Act, if made applicable to minority schools, aided or unaided, will
    be ultra vires Article 30(1) of the Constitution. They  submitted  that
    the majority judgment of this  Court  in  Society  for  Unaided  Private
    Schools of Rajasthan v. Union of India & Anr. (supra), has taken a  view
    that the 2009 Act will not apply to unaided minority  schools  but  will
    apply to aided minority schools.   They submitted that accordingly  sub-
    section (4) of Section 1 of the 2009 Act provides that  subject  to  the
    provisions of articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution, the provisions  of
    the Act shall apply to conferment of rights  on  children  to  free  and
    compulsory education.  They  submitted  that  this  sub-section  (4)  of
    Section 1 of the 2009 Act should be  declared  as  ultra  vires  Article
    30(1) of the Constitution.",

establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.   It is  

essential that the rights available to minorities are protected in regard  

to   institutions   established   and   administered   by   them.     Accordingly, 

institutions   declared   by   the   State   to   be   minority   institutions   under  

clause (1) of article 30 are omitted from the operation of the proposal.





In  P.A.   Inamdar's   case  (supra),  it   was   held   that   the   private 


educational   institutions,   including   minority   institutions,   are   free   to 


admit   students   of   their   own   choice   and   the   State   by   regulatory 


measures   cannot   control   the   admission.     It  was   held   that   the   State 


cannot impose reservation policy to unaided institutions.   The above 


ruling disabled the State to resort to its enabling power under Article  


15(4) of the Constitution.   It was argued by Shri Parasaran that the  


above   rulings   necessitated   the   enactment   of   The   Constitution 


(Ninety-Third   Amendment)   Act,   2005   by   inserting   Article   15(5) 


through which enabling power was conferred on the Parliament and 


the   State   Legislatures,   so   that   they   would   have   the   legislative 


competence   to   pass   a   law   providing   for   reservation   in   educational  


institutions   which   will   not   be   hit   by   Article   19(1)(g).     But   rights   of 


minorities under  Article 30  are not touched by Article 15(5).



45.    As   regards   exemption   of   minority   educational   institutions   in 


Article 15(5), it was contended that this was done to conform with the  


Constitutional   mandate   of   additional   protection   for   minorities   under 


Article 30.   It was argued that Article 15(5) does not override Article  


15(4).     They   have   to   be   read   together   as   supplementary   to   each 


other   and   Article   15(5)   being   an   additional   provision,   there   is   no  


conflict between Article 15(4) and Article 15(5). Article 15(4), 15(5), 


29(2),   30(1),   and   30(2)   all   together   constitute   a   Code   in   relation   to 


admission to educational institutions.  They have to be harmoniously  


construed in the light of the Preamble and Part IV of the Constitution. 



Article   15(5)   also   to   be   taken  as   an   enabling   provision   to   carry  out  


certain constitutional mandate and thus it is constitutionally valid and 


the contentions raised on these grounds are rejected.

3.     Whether exclusion of minority educational institutions from 


Article 15(5) is violative of Article 14 of Constitution?

101. Another contention raised by the petitioner's Counsel is that the 


exclusion of minority institutions under Article 15(5) itself is violative  


of Article 14 of the Constitution.  It was contended that the exclusion 


by itself is not severable from the rest of the provision.  This plea also  


is   not   tenable   because   the   minority   institutions   have   been   given   a  


separate   treatment   in   view   of   Article 30   of   Constitution.     Such  


classification has been held to be in accordance with the provisions 


of the Constitution.  The exemption of minority educational institutions  


has been allowed to conform Article 15(5) with the mandate of Article
30 of the Constitution.  Moreover, both Article 15(4) and Article 15(5) 


are operative and the plea of non-severability is not applicable.",
Article 30,"T.M.A.Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/512761/?formInput=Article%2030,,"91. The right of the minorities to establish and administer educational
institutions is provided for by Article 30(1). To some extent, Article
26(1)(a) and Article 30(1) overlap, insofar as they relate to the
establishment of educational institutions but whereas Article 26 gives the
right both to the majority as well as minority communities to establish and
maintain institutions for charitable purposes, which would inter alia,
include educational institutions, Article 30(1) refers to the right of
minorities to establish and maintain educational institutions of their
choice. Another difference between Article 26 and Article 30 is that
whereas Article 26 refers only to religious denominations, Article 30
contains the right of religious as well as linguistic minorities to
establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.



108. Out attention was invited to the decision in Rev. Father W. Proost and
Ors. v. The State of Bihar and Ors., but the said case has no application
here. In that case, it was contended, on behalf of the State of Bihar, that
as the protection to the minority under Article 29(1) was only a right to
conserve a distinct language, script or culture of its own, the college did
not qualify for the protection of Article 30(1) because it was not founded
to conserve them and that consequently, it was open to all sections of the
people. The question, therefore, was whether the college could claim the
protection of Section 48-B of the Bihar Universities Act read with Article
30(1) of the Constitution, only if it proved that the educational
institution was furthering the rights mentioned in Article 29(1). Section
48-B of the Bihar Universities Act exempted a minority educational
institution based on religion or language from the operation of some of the
other provisions of that Act. This Court, while construing Article 30, held
that its width could not be cut down by introducing in it considerations on
which Article 29(1) was based. Article 29(1) and 30(1) were held to create
two separate rights, though it was possible that they might meet in a given
case. While dealing with the contention of the state that the college would
not be entitled to the protection under Article 30(1) because it was open
to all sections of the people, the Court referred to the observations in
the Kerala Education Bill case, wherein it had been observed that the real
import of Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) was that they contemplated a
minority institution with a sprinkling of outsiders admitted into it. The
Court otherwise had no occasion to deal with the applicability of Article
29(2) to Article 30(1).



141. The grant of aid is not a constitutional imperative. Article 337 only
gives the right to assistance by way of grant to the Anglo-Indian community
for a specified period of time. If no aid is granted to anyone, Article
30(1) would not justify a demand for aid, and it cannot be said that the
absence of aid makes the right under Article 30(1). The founding fathers
have not incorporated the right to grants in Article 30, whereas they have
done so under Article 337; what, then, is the meaning, scope and effect of
Article 30(2)? Article 30(2) only means what it states, viz that a minority
institution shall not be discriminated against when aid to educational
institutions is granted. In other words the state cannot, when it chooses
to grant aid to educational institutions, deny aid to a religious or
linguistic minority institution only on the ground that the management of
that institution is with the minority. We would, however, like to clarify
that if an object surrender of the right to management is made a condition
of aid, the denial of aid would be violative of Article 30(2). However,
conditions of aid that do not involve a surrender of the substantial right
of management would not be inconsistent with constitutional guarantees,
even if they indirectly impinge upon some fact of administration. If,
however, aid were denied on the ground that the educational institution is
under the management of a minority, then such a denial would be completely
invalid.



149. Although the right to administer includes within it a right to grant
admission to students of their choice under Article 30(1), when such a
minority institution is granted the facility of receiving grant-in-aid,
Article 29(2) would apply, and necessarily, therefore, one of the right of
administration of the minorities would be eroded to some extent. Article
30(2) is an injunction against the state not to discriminate against the
minority educational institution and prevent it from receiving aid on the
ground that the institution is under the management of a minority. While,
therefore, a minority educational institution receiving grant-in-aid would
not be completely outside the discipline of Article 29(2) of the
Constitution by no stretch of imagination can the rights guaranteed under
Article 30(1) be annihilated. It is this context that some interplay
between Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) is required. As observed quite
aptly in St. Stephen's case ""the fact that Article 29(2) applies to
minorities as well as non-minorities does not mean that it was intended to
nullify the special right guaranteed to minorities in Article 30(1)."" The
word ""only"" used in Article 29(2) is of considerable significance and has
been used for some avowed purpose. Denying admission to non-minorities for
the purpose of accommodating minority students to a reasonable extent will
not be only on grounds of religion etc., but is primarily meant to preserve
the minority character of the institution and to effectuate the guarantee
under Article 30(1). The best possible way is to hold that as long as the
minority educational institution permits admission of citizens belonging to
the non-minority class to a reasonable extent based upon merit, it will not
be an infraction of Article 29(2), even though the institution admits
students of the minority group of its own choice for whom the institution
was meant. What would be a reasonable extent would depend upon variable
factors, and it may not be advisable to fix any specific percentage. The
situation would vary according to the type of institution and the nature of
education that is being imparted in the institution. Usually, at the school
level, although it may be possible to fill up all the seats with students
of the minority group, at the higher level, either in colleges or in
technical institutions, it may not be possible to fill up all the seats
with the students of the minority group. However, even if it is possible to
fill up all the seats with students of the minority group, the moment the
institution is granted aid, the institution will have to admit students of
the non-minority group to a reasonable extent, whereby the character of the
institution is not annihilated, and at the same time, the rights of the
citizen engrafted under Article 29(2) are not subverted. It is for this
reason that a variable percentage of admission of minority students
depending on the type of institution and education is desirable, and
indeed, necessary, to promote the constitutional guarantee enshrined in
both Article 29(2) and Article 30.",
Article 30,"Islamic Academy Of Education And ... vs State Of Karnataka And Others on 14 August, 2003",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1978528/?formInput=Article%2030,,"Question No. 2
215. The next question for consideration is whether minority and non
minority educational institution stand on the same footing and have the
same rights under the Judgment. In support of the contention that the
minority and non minority educational institutions had the same rights
reliance was placed upon paragraphs 138 and 139 of the Judgment. These read
as follows;

""138. As we look at it, Article 30(1) is a sort of guarantee or assurance
to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to
establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
Secularism and equality being two of the basic features of the
Constitution, Article 30(1) ensures protection to the linguistic and
religious minorities; thereby preserving the secularism of the country.
Furthermore, the principles of equality must necessarily apply to the
enjoyment of such rights. No law can be framed that will discriminate
against such minorities with regard so the establishment and administration
of educational institutions vis-a-vis other educational institutions. Any
law or rule or regulation that would put the educational institutions run
by the minorities at a disadvantage when compared to the institutions run
by the others will have to be struck down. At the same time, there also
cannot be any reverse discrimination. It was observed in St Xaviers College
case, at page 192, that ""the whole object of conferring the right on
minorities under Article 30 is to ensure that there will be equality
between the majority and the minority. If the minorities do not have such
special protection, they will be denied equality."" In other words, the
essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure equal treatment between the majority
and the minority institutions. No one type or category of institution
should be disfavoured or, for that matter receive more favourable treatment
than another. Laws of the land, including rules and regulations, must apply
equally to the majority institutions as well as to the minority
institutions. The minority institutions must be allowed to do what the non-
minority institutions are permitted to do.""



""139 Like any other private unaided institutions, similar unaided
educational institutions administered by linguistic or religious minorities
are assured maximum autonomy in relation thereto; e.g., method of
recruitment of teachers, charging of fees and admission of students. They
will have to comply with the condition of recognition, which cannot be such
as to whittle down the right under Article 30.""

Undoubtedly at first blush it does appear that these paragraphs equate both
types of educational institutions. However on a careful reading of these
paragraphs it is evident that the essence of what has been laid down is
that the minority educational institutions have a guarantee or assurance to
establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. These
paragraphs merely provide that laws, rules and regulations cannot be such
that they favour majority institutions over minority institutions. We do
not read these paragraphs to mean that non minority educational
institutions would have the same rights as those conferred on minority
educational institutions by Article 30 of the Constitution of India. Non
minority educational institutions do not have the protection of Article 30.
Thus, in certain matters they cannot and do not stand on similar footing as
minority educational institutions. Even though the principle behind Article
30 is to ensure that the minorities are protected and arc given an equal
treatment yet the special right given under Article 30 does give them
certain advantages. Just to take a few examples, the Government may decide
to nationalise education. In that case it may be enacted that private
educational institutions Will not be permitted. Non minority educational
institutions may become bound by such an enactment. However, the right
given under Article 30 to minorities cannot be done away with and the
minorities will still have a fundamental right to establish and administer
educational institutions of their choice. Similarly even though the
government may have a right to take over management of a non minority
educational institution the management of a minority educational
institution cannot be taken over because of the protection given under
Article 30. Of course we must not be understood to mean that even in
national interest a minority institute cannot be closed down. Further
minority educational institutions have preferential right to admit students
of their own community/language. No such rights exist so far as non
minority educational institutions are concerned.



QUESTIONS POSED IN T.M.A. PAI FOUNDATION :

26. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation (supra), the Bench framed the following
questions:

1. What is the meaning and content of the expression ""minorities"" in
Article 30 of the Constitution"" of India?

2. What is meant by the expression ""religion"" in Article 30(1)? Can the
followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim
protection under Article 30(1) on the basis that they constitute a minority
in the State, even though the followers of that religion are in majority in
that State?



70. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Writ
Petitioners-Applicant would contend that the discussions in T.M.A. Pai
Foundation centered round the question as to whether the right conferred
upon minorities under Article 30 was subject to Clause (2) of Article 29 or
not. Our attention was drawn to paragraphs 31 to 45 of the judgment and in
particular para 31, 45 and 459 of the judgment. The learned counsel would
submit that while considering the question as to whether the Scheme framed
by this Court in Unni Krishnan was reasonable, it was categorically held
that the provisions contained therein to the extent that 50% seats would be
free seats and 50% thereof would be payment seats and all examinations
would be conducted through Common Entrance Test (CET) and the ceiling on
fees was declared unconstitutional as being violative of Clause (6) of
Article 19 of the Constitution of India. It was submitted that in the event
if it be held that the said provisions are ultra vires for the purpose of
Clause (6) of the Article 19 the same consequences must ensue for
construction of Article 30 of Constitution of India. It was contended that
having regard to the majority decision of this Court, if it is held, having
regard to Clause (2) of Article 29 of the Constitution that in the event an
aid is granted to a professional institution, they will be subject to the
same restrictions which any other self-financed scheme institution would
face in terms of Clause (6) of Article 19 of the Constitution of India then
no purpose can be held to have been achieved by the Constitution (sic) in
enacting Clause (1) of Article 30 of the Constitution of India.",
Article 30,"P.A. Inamdar & Ors vs State Of Maharashtra & Ors on 12 August, 2005",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1390531/?formInput=Article%2030,,"It is next argued that as held in St. Xavier's and re-
affirmed in Pai Foundation the right to establish and administer 
educational institutions by minorities under Article 30 of the 
Constitution is not an absolute right meaning thereby that it is  
subject to such regulations that satisfy a dual test that is : the 
test of 'reasonableness' and 'any regulation regulating the 
educational character of the institutions so that it is conducive to 
making the institution an effective vehicle of education for the 
minority community and for the others who resort to it'. Any 
regulation which impinges upon the minority character of the 
institutions is constitutionally impermissible. It is submitted that 
between the right of minorities to establish and administer the 
educational institutions and the right of the State to regulate 
educational activities for maintaining standard of education, a 
balance has to be struck. The regulation in relation to 
recognition/affiliation operates in the area of standard of 
excellence and are unquestionable if they do not seriously curtail 
or destroy the right of minorities to administer their educational 
institutions. Only in  maintaining standards of education, State 
can insist  by framing regulations that they be followed but in all 
other areas the rights of minority must be protected. It is 
conceded that mal-administration is not protected by Article 30 
of the Constitution. Similarly, secular laws with secular object 
that do not directly impinge upon the right of minority 
institutions and operate generally upon all citizens  do not 
impinge upon Article 30 of the Constitution. This has been the 
constitutional interpretation of Article 30 not because Article 30 
admits no exception like Article 19(6) but because the right 
conferred under Article 30 does not extend to these areas. The 
laws that serve national interest do not impinge upon Article 30.



	In short, education is national wealth essential for the 
nation's progress and prosperity.

Articles 19(1)(g), 29(2) and 30(1): inter-relationship between 

	The right to establish an educational institution, for charity 
or for profit, being an occupation, is protected by Article 19(1)
(g).  Notwithstanding the fact that the right of a minority to 
establish and administer an educational institution would be 
protected by Article 19(1)(g) yet the Founding Fathers of the 
Constitution felt the need of enacting Article 30.  The reasons 
are too obvious to require elaboration.  Article 30(1) is intended 
to instill confidence in minorities against any executive or 
legislative encroachment on their right to establish and 
administer educational institution of their choice.  Article 30(1) 
though styled as a right, is more in the nature of  protection for 
minorities.  But for Article 30, an educational institution, even 
though based on religion or language, could have been 
controlled or regulated by law enacted under Clause (6) of 
Article 19, and so, Article 30 was enacted as a guarantee to the 
minorities that so far as the religious or linguistic minorities are 
concerned, educational institutions of their choice will enjoy 
protection from such legislation. However, such institutions 
cannot be discriminated against by the State solely on account of 
their being minority institutions.  The minorities being 
numerically less qua non-minorities, may not be able to protect 
their religion or language and such cultural values and their 
educational institutions will be protected under Article 30, at the 
stage of law making.  However, merely because Article 30(1) has 
been enacted, minority educational institutions do not become 
immune from the operation of regulatory measure because the 
right to administer does not include the right to mal-administer.  
To what extent the State regulation can go, is the issue.  The 
real purpose sought to be achieved by Article 30 is to give 
minorities some additional protection. Once aided, the autonomy 
conferred by the protection of Article 30(1) on the minority 
educational institution is diluted as provisions of Article 29(2) will 
be attracted.   Certain conditions in the nature of regulations can 
legitimately accompany the State aid.   



30.  To some extent, what may be permissible by way of 
restriction under Article 19(6) may fall foul of Article 30. This is 
the additional protection which Article 30(1) grants to the 
minorities. 

 	The employment of expressions 'right to establish and 
administer' and 'educational institution of their choice' in Article
30(1) gives the right a very wide amplitude.  Therefore, a 
minority educational institution has a right to admit students of 
its own choice, it can, as a matter of its own freewill, admit 
students of non-minority community.  However, non-minority 
students cannot be forced upon it.  The only restriction on the 
freewill of the minority educational institution admitting students 
belonging to non-minority community is, as spelt out by Article
30 itself, that the manner and number of such admissions should 
not be violative of the minority character of the institution.



	In Kerala Education Bill, the scope and ambit of right 
conferred by Article 30(1) came up for consideration.  Article
30(1) does not require that minorities based on religion should 
establish educational institutions for teaching religion only or 
that linguistic minority should establish educational institution for 
teaching its language only.  The object underlying Article 30(1) 
is to see the desire of minorities being fulfilled that their children 
should be brought up properly and efficiently and acquire 
eligibility for higher university education and go out in the world 
fully equipped with such intellectual attainments as will make 
them fit for entering public services, educational institutions 
imparting higher instructions including general secular 
education.  Thus, the twin objects sought to be achieved by 
Article 30(1) in the interest of minorities are: (i) to enable such 
minority to conserve its religion and language, and (ii) to give a 
thorough, good general education to the children belonging to 
such minority.  So long as the institution retains its minority 
character by achieving and continuing to achieve the above said 
two objectives, the institution would remain a minority 
institution.",
Article 30,"T.M.A. Pai Foundation & Ors vs State Of Karnataka & Ors (With Other ... on 31 October, 2002",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/665015/?formInput=Article%2030,,"It is for  the	aforesaid reasons  this	 question  has	been placed before
this Bench.

In view of the referring order the question that arises for consideration
is whether the transposition of the subject Education from List II to List III
has brought change to the test for determining who are minorities for the
purposes of Article 30 of the Constitution.

It may be remembered that various entries in three lists of the Seventh
Schedule are not powers of legislation but field of legislation.  These entries
are mere legislative heads and demarcate the area over which the appropriate
legislatures are empowered to enact law.  The power to legislate is given to
the appropriate legislature by Article 246 and other articles.	Article 245
provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution, Parliament may
make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the
legislature of a State may make laws for whole or any part of the State.
Under Article 246 Parliament has exclusive power to make law with respect
to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule.  Further
under clause (2) of Article 246 Parliament and subject to clause (1) the
legislature of any State are empowered to make law with respect to any of
the matters enumerated in List III Seventh Schedule and under clause (3) of
Article 246, the legislature of any State is empowered to enact law with
respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule
subject to clauses (1) and (2).	 From the aforesaid provisions it is clear that it
is Article 246 and other Articles which either empower Parliament or State
Legislature to enact law and not the Entries finding place in three Lists of
Seventh Schedule.  Thus the function of entries in three lists of the Seventh
Schedule is to demarcate the area over which the appropriate legislatures can
enact laws but do not confer power either on Parliament or State
Legislatures to enact laws. It may be remembered, by transfer of Entries, the
character of entries is not lost or destroyed. In this view of the matter by
transfer of contents of entry 11 of List II to List III as entry 25 has not
denuded the power of State Legislature to enact law on the subject
'Education' but	 has also conferred power on Parliament to enact law on the
subject ""Education"".  Article 30 confers fundamental right to linguistic and
religious minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of
their choice.  The test who are linguistic or religious minorities within the
meaning of Article 30 would be one and the same either in relation to a State
legislation or Central legislation.  There cannot be two tests one in relation
to Central legislation and other in relation to State legislation.  Therefore, the
meaning assigned to linguistic or religious minorities	would not be different
when the subject ""Education"" has been transferred to the Concurrent List
from the State List.  The test who are linguistic or religious minorities as
settled in Kerala Education Bill's case continues to hold good even after
the subject ""Education"" was transposed into Entry 25 List III of Seventh
Schedule by the 42nd Amendment Act.  If we give different meaning to the
expression ""minority"" occurring in Article 30 in relation to a central
legislation, the very purpose for which protection has been given to minority
would disappear.  The matter can be examined from another angle.  It is not
disputed that there can be only one test for determining minority status of
either linguistic or religious minority.  It is, therefore, not permissible to
argue that the test to determine the status of linguistic minority would be
different than the religious minorities. If it is not so, each	linguistic State
would claim protection of Article 30 in its own State in relation to a central
legislation which was not the intention of framers of the Constitution nor the
same is borne out from language of Article 30.	I am, therefore, of the view
that the test for determining who are the minority, either linguistic or
religious, has to be determined independently of which is the law, Central or
State.



 (emphasis supplied)


From the aforesaid four categories of decisions, it appears that there is
not a single decision of this Court where it has been held that Article 30(1) is
not subject to Article 29(2).  On the contrary there are bulk of decisions of
this Court holding that minority institution cannot refuse admission of
members of non-minority community and Article 30(1) is subject to Article
29(2).	 If I go by precedent, it must be held that Article 30(1) is subject to
Article 29(2).	However, learned counsel for minority institutions strongly
relied upon the decision in the case of Rev. Sidhajbai (supra) and argued
that once Article 30(1) is fundamental right declared absolute in terms, it
cannot be subjected to Article 29(2). Since this Bench is of eleven Judges
and decisions of this Court holding that Article 30(1) is subject to Article
29(2) are by lesser number of Judges I shall examine the question
independently.



	It was also urged that if the framers of the Constitution intended to
carve out an exception to Article 30(1), they could have used the words
""subject to the provisions contained in article 29(2)"" in the beginning of
Article 30(1) or could have used the expression ""notwithstanding"" in the
beginning of article 29(2) and in absence of such words it cannot be held
that Article 29(2) is an exception to Article 30(1).	Reference in this regard
was made to Articles 25 and 26 which contained qualifying words.  In fact,
the structural argument was based on the absence of qualifying words either
in Article 29(2) or 30(1).  This argument based on structure of Articles 29(2)
and 30(1) has no merit. In fact, it overlooks that the intention of the framers
of the Constitution was to confer rights consistent with the other members of
society and to promote rather than imperil national interest.  It may be noted
that there is a difference in the language of Articles 25 and 26.  The
qualifying words of Article 25 are ""subject to public order, morality and
health and to the other provisions of this part"".  The opening words of
Article 26 are ""subject to public order, morality and health"".	The absence of
words ""to the other provisions of this part"" as occurring in Article 25 in
Art.26 does not mean that Article 26 is over and above other rights conferred
in Part-III of the Constitution.  In The Durgah Committee, Ajmer & Anr.
vs. Syed Hussain Ali & Ors.  1962(1) SCR 383 and Tilkayat Shri
Govindlalji Maharaj vs. The State of Rajasthan & Ors.  1964(1) SCR
561, it has been held that Article 26 is subject to Article 25 irrespective of
the fact that the words "" subject to other provisions of this part"" occurring in
Article 25 is absent in Article 26.  For these reasons, it must be held that
even if there are no qualifying expressions ""subject to other provisions of
this part"" and ""notwithstanding anything"" either in Article 30(1) or Article
29(2), Article 30(1) is subject to Article 29(2) of the Constitution.



	There is another factor which shows that Article 30(1) is subject to
Article 29(2).	If Article 29(2) is meant for the benefit of minority, there was
no sense in using the word 'caste' in article 29(2).   The word 'caste' is
unheard of in religious minority communities and, therefore, Article 29(2)
was never intended by the framers of the Constitution to confer any
exclusive rights to the minorities.

Although Article 30(1) strictly may not be subject to reasonable
restrictions, it cannot be disputed that Article 30(1) is subject to Article
28(3) and also general laws and the laws made in the interests of national
security, public order, morality and the like governing such institutions will
have to be necessarily read into Article 30(1). In that view of the matter the
decision by this Court in Rev. Sidhajbhai (supra) that under Article 30(1)
fundamental right conferred on minorities is in terms absolute is not borne
out of that Article.  It, therefore, cannot be held that the fundamental right
guaranteed under Article 30(1) is absolute in terms.  Thus, looking into the
precedents, historical fact and Constituent Assembly debates and also
interpreting Articles 29(2) and 30(1) contextually and textually, the irrestible
conclusion is that Article 30(1) is subject to Article 29(2) of the
Constitution.",

DWIVEDI	 J.  (1) The content of the right under	 art.  29(1)
differs	 from  the content of the right	 under	Art.  30(1).
Article	 29(1) secures the right of a..section	of  citizens
having distinct script, language, or culture to conserve the
same.  Article 30(1) on the other hand guarantees the  right
of  a  religious  or linguistic minority  to  establish	 and
administer  educational institutions.  Article	29(1)  gives
security to an interest : article 30(1) gives security to an
activity. [293 D-E]
(2)Article 30(1) does not. in express or  implied  terms,
limit	the  right  of	the.  minorities  to  establish	  an
educational institution of a particular type.  The fight  to
establish  an educational institution impliedly	 grants	 two
kinds of choices.  The minorities have a right to  establish
or  not	 to  establish any particular  type  of	 educational
institution.  This is the negative choice.  The	 minorities,
may establish any type of educational institution.  This  is
the  positive choice.  Choice is inherent in every  freedom.
Freedom	 without  choice is no freedom.	 So  the  words	 ""of
their  choice""	merely make patent what is  latent  in	art.
30(1).	Those words are not intended to enlarge the area  of
choice already implied in the right conferred by art. 30(1).
[293 H, 294 A-B]
(3) Rightaffiliation  : There is not express grant  of	the
right	of  affiliation	 in  art.  30).	  It  is  also	 not
necessarily  implied  in  art. 30(1).  if  the	constitution
framers intended to elevate the right of affiliation to	 the
status	of  a  fundamental  right  they	 could	have  easily
expressed their intention in clear words in art. 30.  As our
State is secular in character, affiliation of an institution
imparting religious instruction or teaching only theology of
a  particular  religious minority may not comport  with	 the
secular	 character  of the State.  As Art.  30(1)  does	 not
grant right of affiliation to such an institution it  cannot
confer	that  right  on	 an  institution  imparting  secular
general	 education.   The content of the  right	 under	art.
30(i) must be the same-for both kinds of institutions.	[294
E-H]
In  re. The Kerala Education Bill [1959]  S.C.R.995  at
pp. 1076-1077.



Article,  30(1) cannot be whittled down by reading it  along
with,  article 29(1).The differences between  article 30(1)
and  29(1) are unmistakable : while article 29	confers	 the
fundamental  right to ""any section. of the  citizens""  which
would  include the majority section.  Article 30(1)  confers
the  right  only  on  minorities.  While  article  29(1)  is
concerned with ""Language, script or culture"", article 30(1)
deals  with divisions of the nation based on  ""religion	 or.
language""; while article 29(1) is concerned with. the  right
to conserve language, script or culture article 30(1)  deals
with  the  right to establish  and  administer	""educational
institutions""  of  the	minorities' own	 choice.   The	word
""administer""  is a word of very wide import.  The other	 key
word&  are  ""of	 their choice"".	 The  minorities,  right  to
administer must necessarily include (i) the right to  choose
its  managing  or governing body; (ii) the right not  to  be
compelled  to refuse admission to students; (iii) the  right
to  choose  its	 teachers;  and (4) the	 right	to  use	 its
properties   and   assets  for	the  benefit  of   its	 own
institution,
Although the minority institutions can claim the  protection
under  Article 30 there are certain activities which  cannot
possibly  be considered educational as for example a  school
of  pickpockets or where subversive or	criminal  activities
are taught.  Such institutions cannot invoke the  protection
of  Article' 30 because they are not imparting education  at
all.  Though the freedom under Article 30 is Unqualified  in
terms,	it  is not free from regulations, There	 can  be  no
absolutes  in a community governed by law.   Accordingly  an
educational  institution  must	comply with  the  laws	like
municipal  laws	 regarding construction and  maintenance  of
buildings.  labour laws, tax laws and so on.  Under  article
30  the permissible regulatory measures are those  which  do
not  restrict the right of. administration to facilitate  it
and  ensure better and more effective exercise of the  right
for   the  benefit  of	the  institution  and  through	 the
instrumentality	  of  the  management  of  the	 educational
institutions, but without displacing the management.  If the
administration	has  to be improved it must be	through	 the
agency or instrumentality of the existing management and not
by   displacing	  it.	 Restrictions  on   the	  right	  of
administration imposed in the interest of the general public
alone  and  not in the interest of and for  the	 benefit  of
minority educational institutions are permissible.
There  is a fundamental distinction between  restriction  on
the right of administration and a regulation prescribing the
manner of administration.  The right of administration means
the  right to effectively manage and conduct the affairs  of
the institutions.  It postulates autonomy in administration.
The right' of administration means the right to conduct	 and
manage the affairs of the institution through a Committee or
body  of  persons  in whom the	management  have  faith	 and
confidence and who have full autonomy in that sphere subject
to  permissible	 regulatory measures, the  right  to  impart
education through one's own teachers having regard to  their
compatibility  with  the ideals and  aims,  aspirations	 and
traditions of the institution.	Educational institutions  do
not want a teacher who though brilliant but is	cantankerous
or  quarrelsome	 or  who is antipathetic to  the  creed	 and
beliefs and practices of the religious minority.  The  right
includes the right to admit students of their choice subject
to  reasonable	regulations about  academic  qualifications.
The  right  to	select and appoint one's  own  teachers	 and
principal  the	right to enforce  discipline  by  exercising



			    191
Articles  29 and 30 Confer four distinct rights.   First  is
the  right  of	any  section of	 the  resident	citizens  to
conserve  its own language, script culture as  mentioned  in
Article	 29(1).	 Second is the right of 'all  religious	 and
linguistic   minorities	  to   establish   and	  administer
educational  institutions  of their choice as  mentioned  in
Article 30(1),.   Third  is the  right	 of  an	 educational
institution not to be discriminated against in the matter of
State aid on the ground that it is under the management of a
religious  or  linguistic minority as mentioned	 in  Article
30(2).	Fourth is the right of the citizen not to be  denied
admission   into  any  State  maintained  or   State   aided
educational  institution on the ground of  religion,  caste,
race or language, as mentioned in Article 29(2).
It  will be wrong to read Article 30(1) as  restricting	 the
right of minorities to establish and administer	 educational
institutions  of  their	 choice only  to  cases	 where	such
institutions are concerned with language, script or  culture
of  the minorities.  The reasons are these.  First,  Article
29  confers  the  fundamental right on any  section  of	 the
citizens  which	 will include the majority  section  whereas
Article 30(1) confers the right on all minorities.   Second,
Article 29(1) is concerned with language, script or culture,
whereas	 Article 30(1) deals with minorities of	 the  nation
based  on  religion or language.  'third, Article  29(1)  is
concerned  with	 the right to conserve language,  script  or
culture,  where	 as Article 30(1) deals with  the  right  to
establish  and	administer educational institutions  of	 the
minorities  of	their choice.  Fourth, the  conservation  of
language,  script or culture under Article 29(1) may  be  by
means  wholly unconnected with educational institutions	 and
similarly  establishment and administration  of	 educational
institutions  by  a  minority under  Article 30(1)  may  be
unconnected with any motive to conserve language, script  or
culture.   A  minority may administer  an  institution	for.
religious  education  which is wholly unconnected  with	 any
question of conserving a language, script or culture.
If  the,  scope	 of  Article 30(1)  is	 to  establish	 and
administer  educational institutions to	 conserve  language,
script	or culture of minorities, it will render Article 30
redundant.  If rights under Articles 29(1) and 30(1) are the
same  then  the	 consequence will be  that  any	 section  of
citizens not necessarily linguistic or religious  minorities
will have the right to establish and administer	 educational
institutions of their choice.  The scope of Article 30 rests
on  linguistic or religious minorities and no other  section
of citizens of India has such a right.



192
Every  section	of  the public,	 the  majority	as  well  as
minority. has rights in respect of religion as	contemplated
Articles,  25  and 26 and rights in,  respect  of  language,
script,	 culture  as contemplated in Article 29.  The  whole
object	of conferring the right on minorities under  Article
30  is	to ensure that there will be  equality	between	 the
majority  and the minority.  If the minorities do  not	have
such special protection they will be denied equality.
In  Re.	  The Kerala Education Bill 1957 [1959]	 S.C.R.	 995
this'  Court  said that Article 30(1)  covers  institution-,
imparting general secular education.  The object of  Article
30  is	to enable children of minorities to go	out  in	 the
world  fully equipped.	All persons whether in the  majority
or in the minority have the right under Article 25 freely to
profess,  practice and propagate religion.  Any	 section  of
citizens which includes the majority as well as the minority
shall  have  under Article 29 the right	 to  conserve  their
distinct  language,  script  or culture.  That	is  why	 the
minorities  are	 given	a  specific  right  in	respect	  of
educational  institutions Linder Article 30. Article 30(1)
gives  the right to linguistic minorities as well  where  no
question  of religion arises.  It is, therefore, not at	 all
possible  to  exclude  secular education  from	Article 30.
Since  the Kerala Education Bill case (supra) in  1959	this
Court  has consistently held that general secular  education
is covered by Article 30.",
Article 30,"Society For Un-Aided P.School Of Raj vs U.O.I & Anr on 12 April, 2012",https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/154958944/?formInput=Article%2030,,"16.    Article 30(1) gives the minorities two rights: (a) to  establish
    and (b) to administer educational institutions of  their  choice.   The
    real import of Article 29(2) and Article 30(1) is that they contemplate
    a minority institution with a sprinkle of outsiders admitted  into  it.
    By admitting a non-member into it the  minority  institution  does  not
    shed its character and cease to be a minority institution.
    17.    The key to Article 30(1) lies in the words “of their choice”.



 18.    The right established by Article 30(1) is  a  fundamental  right
    declared in terms absolute unlike the freedoms guaranteed by Article 19
    which is subject to reasonable restrictions.  Article 30(1) is intended
    to be a real right for the protection of the minorities in  the  matter
    of setting up educational institutions of their own  choice.   However,
    regulations may lawfully be imposed either by legislative or  executive
    action as a condition of receiving grant or of  recognition.   However,
    such regulation must satisfy the test of reasonableness and  that  such
    regulation should make the educational institution an effective vehicle
    of education for the minority community or for the persons  who  resort
    to it.  Applying the above test in the case of Rev.  Sidhajbhai  Sabhai
    v. State of Bombay [1963] SCR 837, this Court held the rule authorizing
    reservation of seats and the threat of withdrawal of recognition  under
    the impugned rule to be violative of Article 30(1).



 19.    The above well-settled principles have to be seen in the context
    of the 2009 Act enacted to implement Article 21A of  the  Constitution.
    At the very outset, the question that arises  for  determination  is  –
    what was the intention of the Parliament?  Is the 2009 Act intended  to
    apply to unaided minority schools?  In answer to the above question, it
    is important to note that in the case of P.A. Inamdar, this Court  held
    that there shall be no reservations in  private  unaided  colleges  and
    that in that regard there shall be no difference between  the  minority
    and non-minority institutions.  However, by the  Constitution  (Ninety-
    third Amendment) Act, 2005, Article 15 is amended.  It is given Article
    15(5).  The result is that P.A.  Inamdar  has  been  overruled  on  two
    counts: (a) whereas this Court in P.A. Inamdar had  stated  that  there
    shall be no reservation in  private  unaided  colleges,  the  Amendment
    decreed that there shall be reservations; (b)  whereas  this  Court  in
    P.A. Inamdar had said that there shall be  no  difference  between  the
    unaided minority and non-minority institutions, the  Amendment  decreed
    that there shall be  a  difference.   Article   15(5)  is  an  enabling
    provision and it is  for  the  respective  States  either  to  enact  a
    legislation or issue an executive instruction providing for reservation
    except in the case of minority educational institutions referred to  in
    Article 30(1).  The intention of the Parliament is  that  the  minority
    educational institution referred to in  Article 30(1)  is  a  separate
    category of institutions which needs protection of  Article 30(1)  and
    viewed in that light we are of the view that unaided minority school(s)
    needs special protection under Article 30(1). Article 30(1)  is  not
    conditional as Article 19(1)(g).  In a sense, it  is  absolute  as  the
    Constitution framers thought that it was the duty of the Government  of
    the day to protect the minorities in  the  matter  of  preservation  of
    culture,  language  and  script  via   establishment   of   educational
    institutions for religious and charitable purposes [See:  Article  26].
    Reservations of 25% in such unaided minority schools result in changing
    the character of the schools if right to establish and administer  such
    schools flows from the  right  to  conserve  the  language,  script  or
    culture, which right is conferred on  such  unaided  minority  schools.
    Thus, the 2009  Act  including  Section  12(1)(c)  violates  the  right
    conferred  on  such  unaided  minority  schools  under  Article 30(1).
    However, when we come to aided minority schools we have to keep in mind
    Article 29(2). As stated, Article 30(1) is subject  to  Article  29(2).
    The said Article confers right of admission upon every citizen  into  a
    State-aided  educational  institution.   Article  29(2)  refers  to  an
    individual right.  It is  not  a  class  right.   It  applies  when  an
    individual  is  denied  admission  into  an   educational   institution
    maintained or aided by the State.  The 2009 Act is  enacted  to  remove
    barriers such as financial barriers which restrict  his/her  access  to
    education.  It is enacted pursuant to Article 21A.  Applying the  above
    tests, we hold that the 2009 Act is constitutionally  valid  qua  aided
    minority schools.



    37.      Learned Additional Solicitor General in her written as well as
    oral submissions stated that Article 21A must be considered as a  stand
    alone provision and not subjected to Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1)
    of the Constitution.   Article  19(1)(g)  and  Article 30(1),  it  was
    submitted, dealt with the subject of right to carry  on  occupation  of
    establishing and administering educational institutions, while  Article
    21A deals exclusively  with  a  child’s  right  to  primary  education.
    Article 21A, it was pointed out, has no saving clause  which  indicates
    that it is meant to be a complete, standalone  clause  on  the  subject
    matter of the right  to  education  and  is  intended  to  exclude  the
    application of Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1).   Learned Additional
    Solicitor General submitted that omission of clause (3) in the original
    proposed  Article  21A  would  indicate  that  the  intention  of   the
    Parliament was  to  apply  the  mandate  of  Article  21A  to  all  the
    educational institutions, public or private, aided or unaided, minority
    or non-minority.",
